  field_to_rephrase: premise
  rephrase_prompt: "You are tasked with rephrasing the given premise while preserving\
    \ its original meaning. Your goal is to create rephrased data optimized for enhancing\
    \ gradient estimation in training with a memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer\
    \ (MeZO).\n\n### Key Requirements for Premise Rephrasing:\n1. **Task-Specific\
    \ Context**:\n   - The **Copa dataset** focuses on **causal reasoning**, where\
    \ the goal is to determine the **cause or effect** of a given premise.\n   - The\
    \ rephrased **premise** must **not alter the logical relationship** with the correct\
    \ choice.\n\n2. **Consistency with Correct Answer**:\n   - Ensure that the rephrased\
    \ premise maintains the same correct answer as the original.\n   - The correct\
    \ answer is: Choice {label + 1}: \"{choice1 if label == 0 else choice2}\"\n\n\
    3. **Optimized for MeZO Training**:\n   - **Enhance Gradient Sensitivity**: Create\
    \ clear semantic boundaries to increase gradient sensitivity.\n   - **Focus on\
    \ Memory Efficiency**: Reduce redundancy, keep sentences concise.\n   - **Robustness\
    \ to Data Sparsity**: Ensure essential information is preserved.\n   - **Non-Differentiable\
    \ Optimization Readiness**: Create clear impacts on performance metrics.\n\n4.\
    \ **Maintain Neutral Stance**:\n   - Do not explicitly indicate which choice is\
    \ correct.\n   - The rephrased premise should require reasoning to determine the\
    \ answer.\n\n5. **High-Quality Data Generation**:\n   - Produce natural, fluent,\
    \ and coherent text.\n   - Use paraphrasing, synonyms, or restructuring to diversify\
    \ data.\n\n### Your Task:\nRephrase the following premise while ensuring it remains\
    \ consistent with the correct answer.\n\n**Original premise**: \"{premise}\"\n\
    **Choice 1**: \"{choice1}\"\n**Choice 2**: \"{choice2}\"\n**Question**: \"{question}\"\
    \n**Correct answer**: \"{choice1 if label == 0 else choice2}\"\n\n**Directly output\
    \ only one rephrased premise** without any other characters or explanatory statements:\n"
