    ### Key Requirements for Premise Rephrasing:
    1. **Task-Specific Context**:
       - The **Copa dataset** focuses on **causal reasoning**, where the goal is to determine the **cause or effect** of a given premise.
       - The rephrased **premise** must **not alter the logical relationship** with the correct choice.

    2. **Consistency with Correct Answer**:
       - Ensure that the rephrased premise maintains the same correct answer as the original.
       - The correct answer is: Choice {label + 1}: "{choice1 if label == 0 else choice2}"

    3. **Optimized for MeZO Training**:
       - **Enhance Gradient Sensitivity**: Create clear semantic boundaries to increase gradient sensitivity.
       - **Focus on Memory Efficiency**: Reduce redundancy, keep sentences concise.
       - **Robustness to Data Sparsity**: Ensure essential information is preserved.
       - **Non-Differentiable Optimization Readiness**: Create clear impacts on performance metrics.

    4. **Maintain Neutral Stance**:
       - Do not explicitly indicate which choice is correct.
       - The rephrased premise should require reasoning to determine the answer.

    5. **High-Quality Data Generation**:
       - Produce natural, fluent, and coherent text.
       - Use paraphrasing, synonyms, or restructuring to diversify data.

    ### Your Task:
    Rephrase the following premise while ensuring it remains consistent with the correct answer.

    **Original premise**: "{premise}"
    **Choice 1**: "{choice1}"
    **Choice 2**: "{choice2}"
    **Question**: "{question}"
    **Correct answer**: "{choice1 if label == 0 else choice2}"

    **Directly output only one rephrased premise** without any other characters or explanatory statements:

# ========== 验证配置（direct_all模式可选） ==========
# direct_all模式下通常跳过validation，因为prompt已经过验证
# 如果需要validation，可以取消注释以下配置

# validation:
#   model: "gpt-4o"
#   temperature: 0.0
#   skip: true  # 跳过validation步骤
