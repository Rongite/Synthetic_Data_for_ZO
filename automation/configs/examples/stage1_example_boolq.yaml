  rephrase_prompt: "You are tasked with rephrasing the given passage while preserving\
    \ its original meaning and ensuring consistency with its associated question and\
    \ boolean answer. Your goal is to create rephrased data optimized for MeZO training.\n\
    \n{{REPHRASE_FEWSHOT}}\n\n### Key Requirements for Passage Rephrasing:\n\n1. **Task-Specific\
    \ Context (BoolQ Dataset)**:\n  - The **BoolQ dataset** consists of yes/no questions\
    \ and short passages.\n  - The task is to determine whether the **passage** supports\
    \ a **\"true\"** or **\"false\"** answer to the **question**.\n  - The rephrased\
    \ **passage** must **not change the answerability or truth value** of the original\
    \ passage.\n\n2. **Consistency with the Original Answer**:\n  - Ensure that the\
    \ rephrased **passage** leads to the **same boolean answer** as the original.\n\
    \  - Do not insert or omit information that would alter the logical basis of the\
    \ answer.\n\n3. **Optimized for MeZO Training**:\n  - Enhance gradient sensitivity\
    \ through varied vocabulary and structure.\n  - Keep the passage concise to reduce\
    \ noise.\n  - Maintain informativeness even if truncated.\n\n4. **High-Quality\
    \ Data Generation**:\n  - Produce natural, fluent, and coherent text.\n  - Use\
    \ paraphrasing, clause reordering, or syntax transformation.\n\n### Your Task:\n\
    Rephrase the following passage while ensuring it leads to the same answer for\
    \ the given question.\n\n**Question**: \"{question}\"\n**Answer**: \"{answer}\"\
    \n**Original passage**: \"{passage}\"\n\n**Directly output only one rephrased\
    \ passage** without any other characters or explanatory statements:\n"
