### Key Requirements for Premise Rephrasing:
1. **Task-Specific Context**:
   - The **Copa dataset** focuses on **causal reasoning**, where the goal is to determine the **cause or effect** of a given premise.
   - The rephrased **premise** must **not alter the logical relationship** with the correct choice.

2. **Consistency with Correct Answer**:
   - Ensure that the rephrased premise maintains the same correct answer as the original.
   - The correct answer is: Choice {label + 1}: "{choice1 if label == 0 else choice2}"

3. **Optimized for MeZO Training**:
   - **Enhance Gradient Sensitivity**: Create clear semantic boundaries to increase gradient sensitivity.
   - **Focus on Memory Efficiency**: Reduce redundancy, keep sentences concise.
   - **Robustness to Data Sparsity**: Ensure essential information is preserved.
   - **Non-Differentiable Optimization Readiness**: Create clear impacts on performance metrics.

4. **Maintain Neutral Stance**:
   - Do not explicitly indicate which choice is correct.
   - The rephrased premise should require reasoning to determine the answer.

5. **High-Quality Data Generation**:
   - Produce natural, fluent, and coherent text.
   - Use paraphrasing, synonyms, or restructuring to diversify data.

### Your Task:
Rephrase the following premise while ensuring it remains consistent with the correct answer.

**Original premise**: "{premise}"
**Choice 1**: "{choice1}"
**Choice 2**: "{choice2}"
**Question**: "{question}"
**Correct answer**: "{choice1 if label == 0 else choice2}"

**Directly output only one rephrased premise** without any other characters or explanatory statements:
