def generate_prompt(premise, hypothesis, label):
    return f"""
            You are tasked with rephrasing the given **premise** while preserving its original meaning and ensuring consistency with its associated **hypothesis**. Your goal is to create rephrased data that enhances the **gradient estimation quality** for a memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer (**MeZO**), which relies on forward passes to estimate gradients.

            ### Key Requirements for Premise Rephrasing:
            1. **Task-Specific Context**:
              - The **RTE dataset** focuses on **textual entailment**, where the goal is to determine whether the **hypothesis** is **entailed or contradicted** with respect to the **premise**.
              - The rephrased **premise** must **not alter the logical relationship** between the **premise** and **hypothesis**.
              - The labels are defined as follows:
                - **0 (Entailment)**: The **premise** supports the **hypothesis**.
                - **1 (Contradiction)**: The **premise** contradicts the **hypothesis**.

            2. **Consistency with the Original Label**:
              - Ensure that the logical relationship between the **premise** and **hypothesis** remains unchanged.
              - If the label is **0 (Entailment)**, the rephrased **premise** must still entail the **hypothesis**.
              - If the label is **1 (Contradiction)**, the rephrased **premise** must still contradict the **hypothesis**.

            3. **Optimized for MeZO Training**:
              - **Enhance Gradient Sensitivity**: Enhance the model's **gradient sensitivity** to subtle variations in input by ensuring clear **semantic boundaries** and well-defined relationships in the rephrased data. Use varied wording, sentence structures, and reorganization of information to **increase data diversity** and **gradient sensitivity**.
              - **Focus on Memory Efficiency**: Reduce redundancy and keep the sentence concise to avoid unnecessary noise.
              - **Robustness to Data Sparsity**: Ensure that the scenarios are robust and provide essential information even with minimal context or details, simulating real-world situations where complete data may not always be available.
              - **Non-Differentiable Optimization Readiness**: Create clear impacts on performance metrics with distinct scenarios, ensuring these scenarios are measurable and distinctly influence model optimization targets.

            4. **Maintain Neutral Stance**:
              - Maintain the **neutral stance** of the original **premise**, carefully avoiding any explicit cues about whether the **hypothesis** is **entailed or contradicted**.
              - Ensure that the rephrased **premise** does not explicitly indicate its relationship to the **hypothesis**. The inference must still be a reasoning task based on the **hypothesis**.
              - The rephrased **premise** should only set the stage for inference without resolving or hinting at the correct relationship.
              - Focus on adding layers of complexity or indirection that require analytical thinking, rather than providing straightforward cues that could lead to quick conclusions.

            5. **High-Quality Data Generation**:
              - Produce a **natural, fluent, and coherent** rephrased **premise**.
              - Avoid directly mirroring the original structure; instead, introduce paraphrasing through synonyms, restructuring, or reordering.

            Original premise: "Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center. That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study. About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found."
            hypothesis: "Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children."

At the same time, the narrative suggests that then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell were largely left out of the decision-making process."
            hypothesis: "Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush."
            label: "0"
            Rephrased premise: "During the Bush administration, a recently revealed account highlights that the Justice Department attorneys drafting memos for contentious interrogation practices were guided by senior administration figures, notably the Vice President at the time, Dick Cheney, along with national security adviser Condoleezza Rice.

            label: "0"
            Rephrased premise: "Lina Joy, originally named Azlina Jailani, was born to Malay parents and brought up in the Islamic faith.
