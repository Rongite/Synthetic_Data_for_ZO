def generate_prompt(premise, hypothesis, label):
    return f"""
            You are tasked with rephrasing the given **premise** while preserving its original meaning and ensuring consistency with its associated **hypothesis**. Your goal is to create rephrased data that enhances the **gradient estimation quality** for a memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer (**MeZO**), which relies on forward passes to estimate gradients.

            ### Key Requirements for Premise Rephrasing:
            1. **Task-Specific Context**:
              - The **RTE dataset** focuses on **textual entailment**, where the goal is to determine whether the **hypothesis** is **entailed or contradicted** with respect to the **premise**.
              - The rephrased **premise** must **not alter the logical relationship** between the **premise** and **hypothesis**.
              - The labels are defined as follows:
                - **0 (Entailment)**: The **premise** supports the **hypothesis**.
                - **1 (Contradiction)**: The **premise** contradicts the **hypothesis**.

            2. **Consistency with the Original Label**:
              - Ensure that the logical relationship between the **premise** and **hypothesis** remains unchanged.
              - If the label is **0 (Entailment)**, the rephrased **premise** must still entail the **hypothesis**.
              - If the label is **1 (Contradiction)**, the rephrased **premise** must still contradict the **hypothesis**.

            3. **Optimized for MeZO Training**:
              - **Enhance Gradient Sensitivity**: Enhance the model's **gradient sensitivity** to subtle variations in input by ensuring clear **semantic boundaries** and well-defined relationships in the rephrased data. Use varied wording, sentence structures, and reorganization of information to **increase data diversity** and **gradient sensitivity**.
              - **Focus on Memory Efficiency**: Reduce redundancy and keep the sentence concise to avoid unnecessary noise.
              - **Robustness to Data Sparsity**: Ensure that the scenarios are robust and provide essential information even with minimal context or details, simulating real-world situations where complete data may not always be available.
              - **Non-Differentiable Optimization Readiness**: Create clear impacts on performance metrics with distinct scenarios, ensuring these scenarios are measurable and distinctly influence model optimization targets.

            4. **Maintain Neutral Stance**:
              - Maintain the **neutral stance** of the original **premise**, carefully avoiding any explicit cues about whether the **hypothesis** is **entailed or contradicted**.
              - Ensure that the rephrased **premise** does not explicitly indicate its relationship to the **hypothesis**. The inference must still be a reasoning task based on the **hypothesis**.
              - The rephrased **premise** should only set the stage for inference without resolving or hinting at the correct relationship.
              - Focus on adding layers of complexity or indirection that require analytical thinking, rather than providing straightforward cues that could lead to quick conclusions.

            5. **High-Quality Data Generation**:
              - Produce a **natural, fluent, and coherent** rephrased **premise**.
              - Avoid directly mirroring the original structure; instead, introduce paraphrasing through synonyms, restructuring, or reordering.

            ### Your Task:
            Rephrase the following **premise** while ensuring that it remains logically consistent with the given **hypothesis** and its **label**. Ensure that the rephrased **premise** enhances **gradient estimation** for **MeZO** by being logically clear, semantically stable, and appropriately diverse.

            **Original premise**: "{premise}"  
            **Hypothesis**: "{hypothesis}"  
            **Label**: "{label}" (0 = **entailment**, 1 = **contradiction**)  

            **Directly output only one rephrased premise** without any other characters or explanatory statements like "The rephrased sentence is:":
