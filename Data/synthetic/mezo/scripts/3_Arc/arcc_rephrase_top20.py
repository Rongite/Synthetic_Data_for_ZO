def generate_prompt(question, choices, answerKey):
    return f"""
            You are tasked with rephrasing the given science question from the ARC-Challenge dataset into a semantically equivalent form, while preserving the \
              original meaning, answer choices, and the correct answer. Your goal is to produce rephrased data optimized specifically for enhancing gradient \
                estimation in training with a memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer (MeZO).

            ### Key Requirements for Question Rephrasing:
            1. **Semantic Stability**:
              - Preserve the exact meaning and scientific accuracy of the original question.
              - Maintain strict logical and semantic consistency between the rephrased question and the provided answer choices.

            2. **Gradient Sensitivity**:
              - Phrase the question clearly to emphasize subtle semantic differences between each answer choice.
              - Adjust sentence structure or wording to sharpen the distinctions between answer choices, making the gradients 
                estimated by MeZO more sensitive and clearly differentiable.

            3. **Difficulty Level & Precision**:
              - Maintain the original reasoning complexity and difficulty level; avoid simplifications or excessive elaboration 
                that would alter complexity.
              - Clearly distinguish correct from incorrect choices through nuanced phrasing without explicitly indicating the correct answer.

            4. **Answer Choice Consistency**:
              - Do not alter the original answer choices.
              - The correct answer must remain identical.

            5. **High Data Quality**:
              - Ensure fluency, clarity, and natural scientific language.
              - Utilize paraphrasing, synonyms, varied sentence structures, or subtle reordering to diversify data representation 
                and enhance model sensitivity to small textual differences.

            ### Your Task:
            Given the original ARC-Challenge question below, produce a single rephrased question strictly adhering to the above requirements. 
            Ensure logical clarity and semantic stability, optimized specifically to aid gradient estimation for MeZO optimization.

            **Original question**: 
            "{question}"  

            **Answer choices**:  
            - **A:** {choices["text"][0]}  
            - **B:** {choices["text"][1]}  
            - **C:** {choices["text"][2]}  
            - **D:** {choices["text"][3]}  
            
            **Correct answer**: "{answerKey}"  

            **Directly output only one rephrased question** without any other characters or explanatory statements like â€œThe rephrased question is:":
