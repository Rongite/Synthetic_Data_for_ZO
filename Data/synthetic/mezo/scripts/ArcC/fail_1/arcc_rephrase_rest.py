            ARC-Challenge Rephrasing Prompt for MeZO Training

            You are tasked with rephrasing the given science question while preserving its original meaning and ensuring consistency with its answer choices. \
              Your goal is to create rephrased data that enhances the gradient estimation quality for a memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer (MeZO), which \
                relies on forward passes to estimate gradients.

            ### Key Requirements for Question Rephrasing:
            1. **Task-Specific Context**:
              - The **ARC-Challenge dataset** consists of multiple-choice science questions that require reasoning and factual knowledge to answer correctly.
              - The rephrased **question** must **not alter the meaning** or the **correct answer**.
              - The structure of the multiple-choice format must be preserved, ensuring that the **rephrased question** still aligns with the **same answer \
                choices**.

            2. **Consistency with the Correct Answer**:
              - Ensure that the **correct answer** remains the **same** after rephrasing..
              - The **other incorrect choices** must still be plausible but incorrect, maintaining the challenge of the original question.
              - Avoid introducing hints or changes that make the question **easier or harder** than the original.

            3. **Optimized for MeZO Training**:
              - **Enhance Gradient Sensitivity**: Enhance the model's **gradient sensitivity** to subtle variations in input by ensuring clear **semantic \
                boundaries** and well-defined relationships in the rephrased data. Use varied wording, sentence structures, and reorganization of information \
                  to **increase data diversity** and **gradient sensitivity**.
              - **Focus on Memory Efficiency**: Reduce redundancy and keep the sentence concise to avoid unnecessary noise.
              - **Robustness to Data Sparsity**: Ensure that the scenarios are robust and provide essential information even with minimal context or details, \
                simulating real-world situations where complete data may not always be available.
              - **Non-Differentiable Optimization Readiness**: Create clear impacts on performance metrics with distinct scenarios, ensuring these scenarios are \
                measurable and distinctly influence model optimization targets.

            4. **Maintain Question Format & Logical Integrity**:
              - Ensure that the **question format** remains a **multiple-choice science question**.
              - Do not modify the number of **choices** or change their **labels (A, B, C, D)**.
              - Do not introduce explicit hints or clues that make the answer more obvious or obscure.
              - The **difficulty level should remain unchanged**â€”preserve the reasoning complexity required to determine the correct answer.

            5. **High-Quality Data Generation**:
              - The **rephrased question** should be **fluent, natural, and scientifically accurate**.
              - Avoid **word-for-word mirroring**; instead, introduce **synonyms, restructuring, and varied phrasing**.
              - Ensure that the **scientific reasoning required to solve the question remains unchanged**.
