def generate_prompt(question, passage, answer):
    return f"""
            You are tasked with rephrasing the given **passage** while preserving its original meaning and ensuring consistency with its associated **question** and **boolean answer**. Your goal is to create rephrased data that enhances the **gradient estimation quality** for a memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer (**MeZO**), which relies on forward passes to estimate gradients.

            ### Key Requirements for Passage Rephrasing:

            1. **Task-Specific Context (BoolQ Dataset)**:
              - The **BoolQ dataset** consists of yes/no questions and short passages. The task is to determine whether the **passage** supports a **"true"** or **"false"** answer to the **question**.
              - The rephrased **passage** must **not change the answerability or truth value** of the original passage with respect to the question.
              - If the original **answer** is **true**, the rephrased passage must continue to support a "yes" response.
              - If the original **answer** is **false**, the rephrased passage must not provide justification to answer "yes".

            2. **Consistency with the Original Answer**:
              - Ensure that the rephrased **passage** leads to the **same boolean answer** as the original.
              - Do not insert or omit information that would alter the logical basis of the answer.

            3. **Optimized for MeZO Training**:
              - **Enhance Gradient Sensitivity**: Design the rephrased passage to respond distinctly to minor variations in input phrasing or token order. Use varied vocabulary and structure to strengthen gradient signal.
              - **Focus on Memory Efficiency**: Avoid verbose phrasing or redundant elaboration. Keep the passage informative yet concise to reduce noise.
              - **Robustness to Data Sparsity**: Ensure the passage remains informative even if truncated or partially occluded, simulating real-world input loss.
              - **Non-Differentiable Optimization Readiness**: Use language that leads to clear decision boundaries (yes/no), enabling optimization of discrete metrics such as accuracy.

            4. **Maintain Informational Neutrality**:
              - Do not insert direct yes/no claims. Let the **question**-to-**answer** reasoning depend entirely on the passage content.
              - Avoid rhetorical or leading language that may bias the answer beyond what the original passage supports.

            5. **High-Quality Data Generation**:
              - Produce a **natural, fluent, and coherent** rephrased passage.
              - Avoid direct copying of the original structure; instead, use paraphrasing, clause reordering, or syntax transformation.

            ### Your Task:
            Rephrase the following **passage** while ensuring that it leads to the same answer for the given **question**. The rephrased passage should maintain logical consistency and enhance MeZOâ€™s gradient estimation effectiveness.

            **question**: "{question}"  
            **answer**: "{'true' if answer else 'false'}"  
            **Original passage**: "{passage}"  

            **Directly output only one rephrased passage** without any other characters or explanatory statements like "The rephrased sentence is:":
