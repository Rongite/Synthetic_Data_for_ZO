Participants were instructed to count the crossings of several white moving objects over the vertical midpoint of a display, while disregarding multiple black moving objects. The unexpected stimulus was a gray cross moving horizontally across the display at varying distances from the vertical midpoint, differing between participants. The researchers found that susceptibility to inattentional blindness rises with age, supporting Graham and Burke's findings, with an increase in age of ten years leading to a 1.3 times higher likelihood of experiencing inattentional blindness. Additionally, they confirmed Most and colleagues' observation that the probability of such blindness intensifies as the distance grows between the observer's attention focus and the unexpected object. However, they noted that age's relationship with inattentional blindness remains unchanged by the unexpected object's distance from the attention focus, indicating that the useful field of view doesn't mediate age-related inattentional blindness."}

The apparatus consists of a Plexiglas sheet placed over a fabric with a bold checkerboard design. On one side, the fabric lies directly underneath the Plexiglas, whereas on the other side, it hangs 4 feet lower. Since the Plexiglas can support an infant's weight, it creates the illusion of a cliff rather than an actual drop. Gibson and Walk utilized this apparatus to study perceptual differences in crawling infants born preterm compared to those born at term without visual or motor impairments."}

Incorporating gravitons into the Standard Model or similar quantum field theories leads to considerable challenges at energy levels near or exceeding the Planck scale. This stems from infinite quantities emerging due to quantum effects; specifically, gravity cannot be renormalized. Since classical general relativity and quantum mechanics appear fundamentally incompatible at these energy scales, the situation is problematic from a theoretical standpoint. An alternative is to use string theories, which are quantum gravity theories that align with classical general relativity and field theory at low energies, but are fully quantum mechanical, include a graviton, and are considered potentially mathematically consistent."}

{"question": "are the normal force and force of gravity always equal", "answer": false, "passage": "In mechanics, the normal force \\( F_n \\) is a component of the contact force acting perpendicular to the surface an object contacts, like a floor or table keeping an object from falling. Here, \"normal\" refers to perpendicularity rather than the everyday meaning of common or usual. For instance, if a person stands still on level ground, the ground reaction force acting on them is purely normal. On a slope, if they remain stationary, the ground reaction force divides into two parts: a normal force perpendicular to the slope and a frictional force parallel to it. Another scenario occurs when an object strikes a surface at speed, where the normal force causes rapid deceleration depending on the flexibility of both the surface and the object."}

The objective is to enhance their driving abilities and avoid being titled Canada\u2019s Worst Driver\u2014short seasons may feature nine drivers. The journey begins with contestants driving from a location about an hour away to the Centre, following provided directions. Upon their arrival, their driving license is taken (in the first two seasons, it was their car keys). The initial episode culminates with an assessment challenge or obstacle course to test their driving skills. The series is famed for its tough obstacle courses, where contestants must navigate tight spaces. To demonstrate that these challenges can be achieved, host Andrew Younghusband, an average driver himself, attempts each one before the contestants. From the second episode onwards, each participant undergoes a performance evaluation with Andrew and four experts. They decide which contestants progress enough to graduate and receive their licenses back. Those who graduate leave with their nominators in the car they arrived in. However, experts may decide not to graduate anyone, graduate multiple contestants, or expel individuals who are unmotivated to improve, should not be driving, or cannot continue for medical or legal reasons. In such cases, expelled contestants also have their licenses returned and go home with their nominators. Even expelled contestants may still be eligible for the title, as was evident in Canada's Worst Driver Ever when Dale Pitton was expelled but returned for the trophy ceremony. In rare, severe cases, the experts might request the Ministry of Transport to review a contestant\u2019s license if deemed medically unfit. This occurred twice; once in Canada's Worst Driver 4 with Donna Hicks, and again in Canada's Worst Driver Ever with Dale. The competition narrows until three contestants remain.

Throughout the sixteenth century, mercury was given to syphilitic patients through various methods, such as topical application, plaster, and oral intake. Another technique involved \"fumigation,\" where mercury vapors were generated over a fire, and patients either sat on an open-bottomed seat above the coals or were placed in a steam-filled box (dubbed a \u201ctabernacle\u201d) exposing their bodies, excluding the head.

The presentation as a table also suggests a specific order for rows and columns, but relations are inherently unordered. Moreover, unless an ORDER BY clause is included in a SELECT statement querying the table, the database system doesn't promise any row order."}

{"question": "is the movie the mission based on a true story", "answer": true, "passage": "\"The Mission draws from real events related to the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, when Spain handed over parts of Jesuit-controlled Paraguay to Portugal. A notable theme in the film is the looming suppression of the Jesuits, highlighted when Father Gabriel is cautioned by the narrator, Cardinal Altamirano, a former Jesuit himself. Altamirano, reflecting in 1758, parallels the historical Jesuit from Andalusia, Father Luis Altamirano, dispatched by Jesuit Superior General Ignacio Visconti to Paraguay in 1752 to facilitate the territorial handover from Spain to Portugal. He managed the relocation of seven missions located south and east of the R\u00edo Uruguay, inhabited by the Guaran\u00ed and Jesuits since the 1600s. Spain offered compensation of 4,000 pesos per mission, translating to less than 1 peso per person for the approximately 30,000 Guaran\u00ed residents, despite the lands, livestock, and infrastructure being valued between 7 and 16 million pesos. The film culminates in the historical Guaran\u00ed War of 1754\u20131756, where the Guaran\u00ed valiantly defended against the Spanish-Portuguese enforcement of the Treaty of Madrid. A historically accurate replica of one of the missions, S\u00e3o Miguel das Miss\u00f5es, was recreated for the film.\""}

{"question": "does puerto rico have to follow us laws", "answer": true, "passage": "Puerto Rico is constitutionally under the plenary powers of Congress as per the territorial clause in Article IV, Section 3, of the U.S. Constitution. This means U.S. federal laws are applicable in Puerto Rico, despite it not being a state and its residents lacking voting representation in Congress. The Federal Relations Act of 1950 ensures that all federal laws, unless deemed \"locally inapplicable,\" automatically apply in Puerto Rico. Since the legislation in 1950 and 1952, only two district court rulings have found a federal law inapplicable to Puerto Rico, with the most recent being overturned on appeal. Efr\u00e9n Rivera Ramos, a law professor at the University of Puerto Rico, explains that while a state's government derives its authority from its people, a territory's government exists solely due to the U.S. Thus, plenary power is akin to exclusive power, allowing the U.S. government to exert authority over territories in ways it cannot over states. Ramos cites Justice Harlan in Grafton v. United States, 206 U.S. 333 (1907), stating that U.S. jurisdiction over territories and their inhabitants is supreme for legitimate governance purposes. However, Ramos notes that this power is not absolute, as it is limited by certain fundamental rights inherent to anyone under U.S. authority."}

Notably, the French Quarter and Garden District were spared from flooding, as they are situated above sea level. Significant breaches occurred at the 17th Street Canal levee, Industrial Canal levee, and the London Avenue Canal floodwall, all contributing extensively to the flooding, as per a 2007 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers. Additionally, this flood catastrophe disrupted oil production and refining, leading to increased global oil prices."}
{"question": "can one point be in two different planes", "answer": true, "passage": "\"To determine an arbitrary point located on the line, consider that any location in space can be expressed as r = c\u2081n\u2081 + c\u2082n\u2082 + \u03bb(n\u2081 \u00d7 n\u2082), since (n\u2081, n\u2082, (n\u2081 \u00d7 n\u2082)) serves as a basis.

Roger Daltrey has remarked that he hadn\u2019t practiced the song beforehand, felt nervous, and couldn\u2019t hear his voice through the monitors.

{"question": "do universal life policies have a cash value", "answer": true, "passage": "\"Universal life insurance, commonly abbreviated as UL, is a cash value life insurance product primarily available in the United States. The policy credits any premiums paid over the insurance cost to the cash value. This cash value accrues interest monthly, while monthly deductions occur due to the insurance cost charge and other fees, regardless of whether a premium is paid that month. Interest rates are set by the insurer but come with a contractual minimum, often 2%. If tied to a financial index like stocks or bonds, the policy is known as an 'Indexed Universal Life' contract. These policies are beneficial in offering guaranteed level premiums throughout the insured's lifetime at lower initial costs compared to similar whole life policies, although the insurance cost rises over time based on a cost index table, typically found within the contract. This allows for straightforward cost comparisons across insurers and is advantageous in irrevocable life insurance trusts since cash considerations are negligible.\""}
{"question": "can someone born on a military base be president", "answer": true, "passage": "The former Panama Canal Zone and its associated military installations were not considered U.S. territory at their time.

This statute was referenced in a 2008 ruling by Judge William Alsup. A paper by former Solicitor General Ted Olson and Harvard Law Professor Laurence H. Tribe in March 2008 asserted that McCain was eligible for the Presidency. Subsequently, in April 2008, the U.S. Senate passed a non-binding resolution acknowledging McCain as a natural-born citizen. In September 2008, Judge William Alsup remarked in his decision that it is very likely McCain was a natural-born citizen at birth due to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401, noting the possibility that he acquired this status retroactively via 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403."}

{"question": "does canada's prime minister hold a seat in the house of commons", "answer": false, "passage": "The House of Commons does not directly elect the prime minister, but it influences the position indirectly. By tradition, the prime minister must be accountable to and have the backing of the House of Commons. When the prime minister's position is vacant, the governor general appoints the individual most likely to secure the House's support, typically the leader of the largest party in the lower house, although a coalition of parties is possible. This has not occurred at the federal level in Canada, but has happened in provincial governments. The leader of the second-largest party, or the largest party not in government in a coalition, usually becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition. Additionally, by unwritten tradition, the prime minister is a member of the House of Commons rather than the Senate. Only two prime ministers, Sir John Abbott (1891\u20131892) and Sir Mackenzie Bowell (1894\u20131896), governed from the Senate, both assuming office after a prime minister's death and without contesting elections."}

{"question": "can you remove venom glands from a snake", "answer": true, "passage": "A venomoid is a type of venomous snake that has been surgically altered to either eliminate or hinder the production of snake venom. This surgery is often performed on venomous snakes kept as pets or employed in public displays to mitigate the danger of potential bites. Venom glands or teeth of showcased snakes can be removed through surgery or crude mutilation; however, some or all such methods are deemed illegal and unethical. Fang removal is rare because snakes often grow new teeth, and the more severe option of excising the underlying maxillary bone could be lethal. Typically, venomoid procedures involve either the extraction of the venom gland or the cutting of the duct between the gland and the fang. Nonetheless, there have been instances where the duct and gland regenerate, leading to instances where supposedly \"safe\" snakes have fatally bitten mice or envenomated humans."}
