{"question": "do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident", "answer": true, "passage": "Good Samaritan laws provide legal protection to individuals who render aid to someone who is, or whom they assume to be, injured, sick, endangered, or otherwise incapacitated. These laws aim to alleviate the reluctance of bystanders to help due to the fear of lawsuits or prosecution for any unintended harm or wrongful death resulting from their assistance. In some common-law regions of Canada, the good Samaritan doctrine ensures that a person who voluntarily assists a victim in distress cannot be successfully sued for any missteps. This principle serves to lessen the apprehension of aiding individuals due to possible legal consequences from errors in help provided. Conversely, a duty to rescue law demands that people provide assistance, holding those who neglect to do so accountable."}
