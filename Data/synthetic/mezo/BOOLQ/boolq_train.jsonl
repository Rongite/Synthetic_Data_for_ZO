{"question": "do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident", "answer": true, "passage": "Good Samaritan laws provide legal protection to individuals who render aid to someone who is, or whom they assume to be, injured, sick, endangered, or otherwise incapacitated. These laws aim to alleviate the reluctance of bystanders to help due to the fear of lawsuits or prosecution for any unintended harm or wrongful death resulting from their assistance. In some common-law regions of Canada, the good Samaritan doctrine ensures that a person who voluntarily assists a victim in distress cannot be successfully sued for any missteps. This principle serves to lessen the apprehension of aiding individuals due to possible legal consequences from errors in help provided. Conversely, a duty to rescue law demands that people provide assistance, holding those who neglect to do so accountable."}

{"question": "does a goal from a throw in count", "answer": false, "passage": "A throw-in cannot result in a direct goal; if the ball enters the thrower's own goal without another player's contact, the opposing team is awarded a corner kick. Similarly, if the ball goes directly into the opponent's goal from a throw-in, the defending team receives a goal kick. In both scenarios, the throw-in does not count as a scored goal."}
{"question": "the visual cliff is a device for studying", "answer": true, "passage": "The visual cliff apparatus, developed by Cornell University psychologists Eleanor J. Gibson and Richard D. Walk, serves as a research tool for investigating depth perception across human and animal species. This experimental device features a transparent Plexiglas sheet covering a checkerboard-patterned cloth. The design creates an optical illusion: on one side, the cloth sits directly beneath the Plexiglas, while on the other side, it appears approximately 4 feet below. Since the Plexiglas fully supports the infant's weight, this creates a visual perception of a cliff rather than an actual drop-off, ensuring subject safety while allowing researchers to manipulate visual and tactical stimuli. Gibson and Walk utilized this apparatus to examine potential perceptual differences between preterm and full-term human infants at crawling age, focusing on those without documented visual or motor impairments."}

{"question": "is the graviton part of the standard model", "answer": false, "passage": "The graviton, a theoretical particle associated with gravitational force, exists outside the Standard Model framework. Quantum theories that attempt to incorporate gravitons into the Standard Model or other quantum field theories encounter significant theoretical challenges at energy levels approaching or exceeding the Planck scale. These difficulties arise from infinities generated by quantum effects, making gravitation non-renormalizable. The apparent incompatibility between classical general relativity and quantum mechanics at these energy levels creates a theoretically unsustainable situation. String theories offer a potential resolution by substituting particles with strings, functioning as quantum theories of gravity that simplify to classical general relativity plus field theory at lower energies while maintaining mathematical consistency and accommodating the graviton concept."}
{"question": "is st david's day a bank holiday in wales", "answer": false, "passage": "Saint David's Day, unlike Saint Patrick's Day in Ireland, is not recognized as a national holiday, despite significant public backing for its designation as a bank holiday in Wales.

A 2006 survey revealed that 87% of Welsh residents desired bank holiday status for Saint David's Day, with 65% willing to give up another bank holiday in exchange. However, a 2007 petition requesting bank holiday status for Saint David's Day was declined by then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair's office."}
{"question": "are the normal force and force of gravity always equal", "answer": false, "passage": "The normal force, denoted as Fn, represents the component of contact force acting perpendicular to the surface an object touches. This differs from the common usage of \"normal\" as it refers to perpendicularity in the geometric sense. For instance, when someone stands motionless on a flat surface, they experience only a normal force as part of the ground reaction force. However, on an inclined surface where the person doesn't slide downward, the ground reaction force splits into two components: the normal force perpendicular to the ground and a frictional force parallel to it. Additionally, when an object strikes a surface with velocity, assuming the surface can withstand the impact, the normal force causes rapid deceleration, which varies based on the flexibility of both the object and surface."}

{"question": "can you marry your sister in the uk", "answer": false, "passage": "In the United Kingdom, laws concerning sexual offenses vary by region due to devolution. Sexual relations with adult relatives\u2014including parents (biological or adoptive), grandparents, children (biological or adopted), grandchildren, siblings (full or half), uncles, aunts, nephews, or nieces\u2014are prohibited. For England and Wales, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 replaced the traditional incest offense with broader categories: familial child sex offenses (sections 25-29) and sexual activity with adult relatives (sections 64-65). While these regulations aim to protect individuals from potential harm, they nonetheless prohibit consensual sexual relationships between family members, regardless of mutual consent or awareness of consequences. Some scholarly discussion has examined the rhetoric employed by the Sexual Offences Review Team, with Roffee noting how the language used influences readers to view consensual familial sexual acts as both illegal and immoral. In Northern Ireland, comparable prohibitions exist under the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008."}

{"question": "is electrode potential the same as reduction potential", "answer": true, "passage": "The electrode potential, when referring to standard conditions, is typically expressed as the standard reduction potential. This is because in a redox reaction, the oxidation potential of a half-reaction equals the negative value of its reduction potential. While the total potential of a cell can be measured, isolating and accurately measuring individual electrode/electrolyte potentials presents significant challenges. It's worth noting that electric potential values fluctuate with changes in temperature, concentration, and pressure. Given the mathematical relationship between oxidation and reduction potentials, scientists generally find it sufficient to calculate just one of these values."}

{"question": "was mercury used as a cure for syphilis", "answer": true, "passage": "Mercury served as a widespread, enduring remedy for syphilis, potentially dating back to The Canon of Medicine (1025) authored by Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna)\u2014though this timeline depends on whether syphilis existed in the Old World before Columbus (see \u00a7 Origin). Paracelsus emerged as an early advocate for mercury treatments due to its beneficial effects on Arabic leprosy treatments, which was considered related to syphilis. In 1496, Giorgio Sommariva of Verona reportedly utilized mercury to treat syphilis and is frequently credited as the pioneering physician to do so, despite possibly lacking formal medical credentials. Throughout the 16th century, mercury was administered to syphilis patients through various methods: skin application, plaster application, and oral consumption. A \"Fumigation\" technique was also employed, wherein mercury was vaporized over fire and patients were exposed to the resulting vapors\u2014either by sitting on a bottomless seat above hot coals or by having their body (except the head) enclosed in a \"tabernacle\" box that captured the steam. The intended outcome of mercury treatment was to induce salivation, believed to expel the disease. Mercury treatment carried unpleasant side effects including gum ulcers and tooth loosening. Mercury remained in use for syphilis treatment for hundreds of years; an 1869 article by TJ Walker examined mercury injection as a treatment method."}

When sperm concentration falls below normal levels, the condition is termed oligozoospermia. In vasectomy procedures, success is primarily determined by achieving azoospermia (complete absence of sperm). However, success definitions vary among practitioners\u2014some accept rare non-motile sperm (under 100,000 per milliliter), while others recommend follow-up semen analysis to ensure counts aren't increasing due to re-canalization, and some physicians may perform a second vasectomy in such cases."}

{"question": "does a trapezoid have one set of parallel lines", "answer": true, "passage": "In Euclidean geometry, a trapezoid is defined in American and Canadian English as a convex quadrilateral that contains at least one pair of parallel sides. Outside North America, this same shape is known as a trapezium. The sides that run parallel to each other are designated as the bases of the trapezoid, while the remaining two sides are termed the legs or lateral sides (unless they too are parallel, which would create two pairs of bases). A trapezoid with no equal sides is specifically classified as a scalene trapezoid, distinguishing it from other specialized variations of this geometric figure."}
{"question": "does prime minister have to be an mp", "answer": false, "passage": "The Prime Minister position is established through longstanding convention rather than by constitutional or statutory documentation. This convention dictates that the monarch must appoint whoever is most likely to maintain the House of Commons' confidence\u2014typically the leader of the party or coalition controlling the most seats. Rather than being deliberately created, this role evolved gradually over three centuries through various Parliamentary acts, political shifts, and historical circumstances. Understanding the position requires historical context, particularly the Constitutional changes during the Revolutionary Settlement (1688-1720) when political authority shifted from Sovereign to Parliament. While the Sovereign retained legal prerogative powers and technically remained government head, political reality necessitated governance through a Prime Minister capable of commanding Parliamentary majority."}

{"question": "does puerto rico have to follow us laws", "answer": true, "passage": "Puerto Rico falls under the territorial clause of Article IV, section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress plenary powers over it. Despite not being a state and having no voting representatives in Congress, Puerto Rico must adhere to U.S. federal laws. The Federal Relations Act of 1950 established that all federal laws \"not locally inapplicable\" automatically apply to Puerto Rico. Since this legislation, only two district court decisions have ruled specific federal laws inapplicable to Puerto Rico, with the most recent decision overturned on appeal. Efr\u00e9n Rivera Ramos, Dean and Professor at the University of Puerto Rico School of Law, explained that plenary power essentially means exclusive power\u2014a territory's government exists solely because of the United States, unlike state governments which derive power from their citizens. Citing Justice Harlan's opinion in Grafton v. United States (1907), Ramos noted that U.S. authority over territories is \"paramount\" for all legitimate governmental purposes, though this power is constrained by certain fundamental rights afforded to anyone under U.S. governmental authority."}
{"question": "does every us citizen have a social security number", "answer": false, "passage": "Social Security was established as a universal tax, but following the introduction of Medicare in 1965, religious groups that existed before 1951 were granted exemptions from the system. Consequently, not all Americans participate in Social Security, and some individuals do not possess a Social Security number. Nevertheless, parents must provide Social Security numbers to claim children as dependents on federal tax returns, and the Internal Revenue Service mandates that all corporations collect SSNs (or alternative identification numbers) from their employees, as detailed below. Groups like the Old Order Amish have actively resisted universal Social Security implementation by challenging regulations, such as the requirement to provide a Social Security number when applying for a hunting license."}
{"question": "can anything be faster than the speed of light", "answer": false, "passage": "According to the special theory of relativity, only particles possessing zero rest mass can achieve light speed. While theoretical particles called tachyons\u2014which would move faster than light\u2014have been proposed, their existence would violate the principle of causality. The scientific consensus among physicists maintains that such particles cannot exist in reality. The concepts of faster-than-light (FTL), superluminal communication, and travel describe the theoretical transmission of information or matter exceeding light speed, but these remain physically impossible under our current understanding of physics."}

{"question": "was the french quarter affected by hurricane katrina", "answer": false, "passage": "The hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans resulted in approximately 23 breaches in the drainage canal and navigational canal levees and floodwalls. Under the Flood Control Act of 1965, the United States Army Corps of Engineers was responsible for designing and constructing these levees, while the Orleans Levee Board was tasked with their maintenance. Engineering experts consider these levee and floodwall failures during Katrina to be the worst engineering catastrophe in U.S. history. By August 31, 2005, flooding had affected 80% of New Orleans, with water depths reaching 15 feet in some areas. The 17th Street Canal levee, Industrial Canal levee, and London Avenue Canal floodwall experienced major breaches that caused most of the flooding, according to a June 2007 American Society of Civil Engineers report. Notably, the French Quarter and Garden District remained dry because these historic areas are situated above sea level. The flooding disaster disrupted oil production and refining operations, leading to worldwide increases in oil prices."}
{"question": "can one point be in two different planes", "answer": true, "passage": "To find the intersection of two planes, we can express any point in space using the formula r = c\u2081n\u2081 + c\u2082n\u2082 + \u03bb(n\u2081 \u00d7 n\u2082), where (n\u2081, n\u2082, n\u2081 \u00d7 n\u2082) forms a basis. When seeking a point that exists simultaneously on both planes\u2014meaning it belongs to their intersection\u2014we substitute this expression into each plane's equation. This generates two simultaneous equations that can be solved for the coefficients c\u2081 and c\u2082. The solution confirms that a single point can indeed lie on two different planes, specifically at their line of intersection where the planes meet."}

MacLean's triune brain theory, is theorized to predate other forebrain regions in evolutionary development. MacLean proposed that this system evolved to regulate the fight-or-flight response circuits first documented by Hans Selye in his 1936 General Adaptation Syndrome report. This ancient brain structure appears to serve survival functions across both reptilian and mammalian species, including humans. In MacLean's model, the human brain comprises three evolutionary components that developed sequentially over time, with newer structures forming at the superior and anterior positions.

Several explanations exist for this characteristic: one suggests the song began as a slow blues number without stuttering until Pete Townshend was influenced by John Lee Hooker's \"Stuttering Blues\"; another claims it was recommended to Roger Daltrey to mimic a British mod on amphetamines; a less common theory proposes the stutter was designed to imply profanity in the lyrics: \"Why don't you all fff... fade away!\" Producer Shel Talmy, however, maintained it was merely \"one of those happy accidents\" worth preserving. Daltrey himself explained that he hadn't practiced the song before recording, felt nervous, and couldn't hear himself through the monitors, causing him to stutter while trying to match lyrics to music\u2014an effect the band decided to keep.

There have been documented cases of intestinal perforations from bay leaves, creating a risk of surgical emergencies. For this reason, most culinary guidelines advise removing bay leaves before serving unless they've been ground into powder. It's important to note that the toxic varieties of laurel are never sold for culinary purposes."}

{"question": "do universal life policies have a cash value", "answer": true, "passage": "Universal life insurance (UL) is a form of life insurance with cash value components, primarily marketed in the United States. The policy structure allows premium payments exceeding the current insurance cost to be added to the policy's cash value. Monthly, this cash value receives interest credits while being reduced by cost of insurance (COI) charges and other policy fees, regardless of whether premiums were paid that month. The interest rate is determined by the insurance company but includes a guaranteed minimum rate (typically 2%). When the earnings are linked to financial indices like stocks, bonds, or interest rates, the policy becomes an \"Indexed Universal Life\" contract. These policies offer the benefit of guaranteed level premiums throughout the policyholder's life at initially lower costs than comparable whole life policies, though the insurance cost increases over time as shown in the cost index table (usually found on page 3 of the contract). This feature facilitates easy cost comparison between insurers and works effectively in irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILITs) where cash considerations are not significant."}
{"question": "can someone born on a military base be president", "answer": true, "passage": "The Panama Canal Zone, previously an unincorporated territory with military installations, was not considered U.S. territory at the time. However, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403, enacted in 1937, retroactively granted citizenship to individuals born in the Canal Zone after February 26, 1904, and to those born in Panama after that date with at least one parent who was a U.S. citizen working for the U.S. government or Panama Railway Company. This statute was referenced in Judge William Alsup's 2008 ruling. A paper published in March 2008 by former Solicitor General Ted Olson and Harvard Law Professor Laurence H. Tribe concluded that McCain was eligible for the Presidency. The U.S. Senate passed a non-binding resolution in April 2008 acknowledging McCain's natural-born citizen status. In September 2008, U.S. District Judge William Alsup noted in his ruling that McCain is \"highly probable\" to be a natural-born citizen from birth under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401, while also recognizing the possibility that McCain became a natural-born citizen retroactively through 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403."}

This requirement stems partly from the legal concept that minors cannot provide informed consent or enter into binding contracts. Most states allow individuals under 18 to receive tattoos with parental or guardian consent, though some jurisdictions completely forbid tattooing below certain ages regardless of permission, making exceptions only for medical necessities such as radiation therapy markings."}
{"question": "are there two versions of ren and stimpy", "answer": true, "passage": "Ren & Stimpy exists in two distinct iterations: the original children's series that aired on Nickelodeon, and a later adult-oriented version called \"Ren & Stimpy 'Adult Party Cartoon'\" (also known as \"Ren & Stimpy's All New Adult Party Cartoon\").

{"question": "does canada's prime minister hold a seat in the house of commons", "answer": false, "passage": "The House of Commons does not officially elect the prime minister, but indirectly influences the position. By convention, the prime minister must maintain the support of this lower house and is accountable to it. When the prime minister's office becomes vacant, the governor general appoints the person most likely to command House support\u2014typically the leader of the largest party, though coalitions are possible. While this hasn't occurred in federal parliament, it has happened provincially. The leader of the second-largest party (or largest opposition party in a coalition) generally becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition. Although unwritten convention suggests the prime minister should be a member of the House of Commons rather than the Senate, this isn't mandatory. In fact, two prime ministers have governed from the Senate: Sir John Abbott (1891-1892) and Sir Mackenzie Bowell (1894-1896), both assuming office following a prime minister's death and neither contesting elections."}

{"question": "can you remove venom glands from a snake", "answer": true, "passage": "A venomoid refers to a venomous snake that has undergone a surgical intervention to either remove or inhibit its venom production capabilities. This procedure is typically performed on venomous snakes kept as pets or used in demonstrations to eliminate the risk of envenomation during handling. The methods for creating venomoids vary, including surgical extraction of venom glands or disruption of the venom delivery system\u2014practices that have faced legal challenges and ethical scrutiny. While fang removal is less common due to snakes' ability to regenerate teeth (and because removing the maxillary bone would be lethal), most venomoid procedures involve either extracting the venom gland or cutting the duct connecting the gland to the fang. It's important to note that these modifications aren't always permanent, as both ducts and glands can regenerate over time, resulting in supposedly \"safe\" venomoid snakes that have later killed prey animals and successfully envenomated humans."}
{"question": "do they sell beer in grocery stores in new jersey", "answer": true, "passage": "New Jersey's liquor laws have several distinctive characteristics. The state restricts corporations to owning only two retail distribution licenses, which effectively prevents chain stores from selling alcohol. This limitation, combined with local municipal regulations, significantly restricts supermarket and convenience store chains from offering beer\u2014unlike the common practice in numerous other states. Additionally, New Jersey law classifies drunk driving as a traffic violation rather than a criminal offense and allows individual municipalities to establish their own parameters for underage drinking regulations."}

{"question": "is it possible for a triangle to have more than one obtuse angle", "answer": false, "passage": "A triangle can be classified as acute when all three of its angles are acute (measuring less than 90\u00b0). Alternatively, a triangle is considered obtuse when it contains exactly one obtuse angle (measuring more than 90\u00b0) and two acute angles. Due to the fundamental geometric principle that the sum of all angles in any triangle must equal 180\u00b0, it is mathematically impossible for a triangle to contain more than a single obtuse angle."}

{"question": "do both feet leave the ground when running", "answer": true, "passage": "Running is a form of land-based movement that enables humans and animals to travel quickly on their feet. It is distinguished from walking by having an aerial phase where all feet are simultaneously off the ground (with some exceptions). In contrast, walking maintains constant ground contact with at least one foot, keeps legs relatively straight, and moves the center of gravity over the supporting leg in an inverted pendulum motion. From a spring-mass mechanics perspective, running bodies exhibit simultaneous changes in kinetic and potential energy within each stride, storing energy through elastic tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The activity of running encompasses various speeds, ranging from slower jogging to rapid sprinting."}

{"question": "is the separation of powers in the australian constitution", "answer": false, "passage": "The Westminster system, which Australia follows, requires ministers from the executive branch to be members of Parliament (the legislative branch), adhering to the principle of Responsible Government. This requirement is explicitly stated in section 64 of the Australian Constitution. While a theoretical doctrine of complete separation of powers exists, no constitutional system in practice maintains absolute separation between branches of government. Instead, some overlap naturally occurs, though balanced by a system of checks and balances. This partial integration of executive and legislative functions demonstrates that Australia's constitutional framework does not implement a strict separation of powers."}

{"question":"can you phone 999 without a sim card","answer":false,"passage":"The pan-European 112 code was introduced in the UK in April 1995 with little publicity. It connects to existing 999 circuits. The GSM standard mandates that the user of a GSM phone can dial 112 without unlocking the keypad, a feature that can save time in emergencies but that also causes some accidental calls. All mobile telephones will make emergency calls with the keypad locked. Originally a valid SIM card was not required to make a 999\/112 emergency call in the UK. However, as a result of high numbers of untraceable hoax calls being made, this feature is now blocked by all UK networks. Most UK mobile telephone handsets will dial 999\/112 without a SIM inserted (or with a locked\/invalid SIM), but the call will not be connected. Following the blocking of SIM-less calls, in 2009 the UK networks introduced emergency call roaming. This allows a user with a valid SIM of a UK network to make emergency calls on any network for which they have coverage."}

{"question":"does fez ever say where he is from","answer":false,"passage":"Fez's secret country of origin is one of the longest running gags on the show. Through all eight seasons, Fez's nationality remains a mystery, even to his closest friends, and the continual hints and clues Fez drops about his country only leave them more confused. In the episode ``Eric's Birthday,'' Kitty, fantasizing about Eric's friends causing trouble, imagines Fez saying, ``in my home country of...wherever it is I'm from; I can never tell...'' Much is revealed in the episode ``Love of My Life,'' where one of Fez's compatriots (played by Justin Long) comes for a visit. In the first teaser, when his friend suggests that he goes home, he says ``Yes, I will go to Brazil...and then catch a flight home.'' In the final teaser, when Hyde finally asks them, ``Where the hell are you guys from?'', his friend says that the name depends on whether you ask the British or the Dutch. But the British won't say it, Fez explains, because they hate the island, and no one understands a word the Dutch say. The friend has a heavy English accent; Fez's explanation to this is that his friend is from the west side of the island. We also see throughout the show that Fez almost says where he is from but then stops right before he says it."}

{"question":"are great horned owls active during the day","answer":false,"passage":"Like most owls, the great horned owl makes great use of secrecy and stealth. Due to its natural-colored plumage, it is well camouflaged both while active at night and while roosting during the day. During the daytime it roosts usually in large trees (including snags & large hollows but usually thick branches) but may occasionally be in crevices or small caves in rocks or in dense shrubbery. Pine and other coniferous trees may be preferred where available since they are particularly dense and provide cover throughout the year. Typically, males have a favorite roosting site not far from the nest, sometimes used over successive years. While roosting, great horned owls may rest in the ``tall-thin'' position, where they sit as erect and hold themselves as slim as is possible. The kind of posture is well known as a further method of camouflage for other owls, like long-eared owls or great grey owls, especially if humans or other potential mammalian carnivores approach them. The Eurasian eagle owl rarely, if ever, assumes the tall-thin position. Outside of the nesting season, great horned owls may roost wherever their foraging path ends at dawn. Generally great horned owls are active at night, although in some areas may be active in the late afternoon or early morning. At dusk, the owl utters a few calls before flying to a more open sing-post, i.e. large bare branch or large rocks to deliver song. Normally several perches are used to mark occupied territory or to attract a female. Despite its camouflage and cryptic locations, this species can still sometimes be spotted on its daytime roosts, especially by American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Since owls are, next to red-tailed hawks, perhaps the main predator of crows and their young, crows sometimes congregate from considerable distances to mob owls and caw angrily at them for hours on end. When the owls try to fly off to avoid this harassment, they are often followed by the corvids."}

Cedric Maxwell is the only Finals MVP winner eligible for the Hall of Fame who has not been voted in."}
{"question":"is a bramble the same as a blackberry","answer":true,"passage":"In British English, a ``bramble'' is any rough (usually wild) tangled prickly shrub--specifically the blackberry bush (Rubus fruticosus)--or any hybrid of similar appearance, with thorny stems. Bramble or brambleberry may also refer to the blackberry fruit or products of its fruit (e.g., bramble jelly). The shrub grows abundantly in all parts of the British Isles and harvesting the fruits in late summer and autumn is often considered a favourite pastime. It can also become a nuisance in gardens, sending down its strong suckering roots amongst hedges and shrubs. Many consider it a weed due its tendency to grow in neglected areas and its sharp, tough thorns which can be hazardous to children and pets."}

L. 73-22, 48 Stat. 74, codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77a et seq.), was enacted by the US Congress on May 27, 1933, during the Great Depression, after the stock market crash of 1929. Legislated pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution, it requires every offer or sale of securities that uses the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce to be registered with the SEC pursuant to the 1933 Act, unless an exemption from registration exists under the law. The term ``Means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce'' is extremely broad, and it is virtually impossible to avoid the operation of the statute by attempting to offer or sell a security without using an ``instrumentality'' of interstate commerce. Any use of a telephone, for example, or the mails would probably be enough to subject the transaction to the statute."}

{"question":"is it dangerous to eat a bay leaf","answer":true,"passage":"Some members of the laurel family, as well as the unrelated but visually similar mountain laurel and cherry laurel, have leaves that are poisonous to humans and livestock. While these plants are not sold anywhere for culinary use, their visual similarity to bay leaves has led to the oft-repeated belief that bay leaves should be removed from food after cooking because they are poisonous. This is not true; bay leaves may be eaten without toxic effect. However, they remain unpleasantly stiff even after thorough cooking, and if swallowed whole or in large pieces, they may pose a risk of harming the digestive tract or causing choking. There have been cases of intestinal perforations caused by swallowing bay leaves, so unless the leaves in the recipe have been ground they should be removed from the food before serving; otherwise, the risk of a surgical emergency remains. Thus, most recipes that use bay leaves will recommend their removal after the cooking process has finished."}
{"question":"is anyone with 3000 hits not in the hall of fame","answer":true,"passage":"Baseball writer Josh Pahigian writes that membership in the club has been ``long considered the greatest measure of superior bat handling.''

Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame because he was permanently banned from baseball in 1989. After four years on the ballot, Palmeiro failed to be named on 5% of ballots in 2014, and accordingly his name was removed from the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot for future elections, although it is possible that the Veterans Committee could in the future enshrine him. Twenty-one different teams have had a player reach 3,000 hits."}

The bacterium is commonly found in hot tubs, water slides, and such places. Children are more prone to this because they usually stay in the water longer than adults. Hot tub folliculitis appears on the skin in the form of a rash, roughly resembling chicken pox and then develops further to appear as a pimple. Hot tub folliculitis can be extremely painful and\/or itchy, and left alone without scratching will go away much more quickly. If the rash is aggravated, it can stay, worsen, and spread, lasting for months. By that time, it is much more difficult to treat. The dots usually go away after about 7 to 10 days but the condition leaves a hyperpigmented lesion that goes away after a few months."}

{"question":"is l2 acquisition the same as l1 acquisition","answer":false,"passage":"Adults who learn a second language differ from children learning their first language in at least three ways: children are still developing their brains whereas adults have mature minds, and adults have at least a first language that orients their thinking and speaking.

This lack of native pronunciation in adult learners is explained by the critical period hypothesis. When a learner's speech plateaus, it is known as fossilization."}

{"question":"has ireland ever been part of the uk","answer":true,"passage":"The 1614 overthrow of the Catholic majority in the Irish Parliament was realised principally through the creation of numerous new boroughs which were dominated by the new settlers. By the end of the seventeenth century, recusants (adherents to the older religion were now termed), representing some 85% of Ireland's population, were then banned from the Irish Parliament.

Political power thereafter rested entirely in the hands of a Protestant Ascendancy minority, while Catholics and members of dissenting Protestant denominations suffered severe political and economic privations under the Penal Laws. The Irish Parliament was abolished from 1 January 1801 in the wake of the republican United Irishmen Rebellion and Ireland became an integral part of a new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the provisions of the Acts of Union 1800.

It explains the behavior of the rate of increase in output (production) relative to the associated increase in the inputs (the factors of production) in the long run. In the long run all factors of production are variable and subject to change due to a given increase in size (scale). While economies of scale show the effect of an increased output level on unit costs, returns to scale focus only on the relation between input and output quantities."}

{"question":"is the sweat gland part of the endocrine system","answer":false,"passage":"The endocrine system is the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs. The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen."}

{"question":"do fatty acid synthesis and degradation occur in the same location of the cell","answer":false,"passage":"Fatty acids are broken down to acetyl-CoA by means of beta oxidation inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose."}

{"question":"is a drop kick still legal in the nfl","answer":true,"passage":"In 1934, the ball was made more pointed at the ends. The creation of the pointed football is generally credited to Shorty Ray, at the time a college football official and later the NFL's head of officiating. This made passing the ball easier, as was its intent, but made the drop kick obsolete, as the more pointed ball did not bounce up from the ground reliably. The drop kick was supplanted by the place kick, which cannot be attempted out of a formation generally used as a running or passing set. The drop kick remains in the rules, but is seldom seen, and rarely effective when attempted. In Canadian football the drop kick can be taken from any point on the field, unlike placekicks which must be attempted behind the line of scrimmage."}

{"question":"is it possible to have a refractive index less than 1","answer":true,"passage":"According to the theory of relativity, no information can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum, but this does not mean that the refractive index cannot be lower than 1. The refractive index measures the phase velocity of light, which does not carry information. The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests of the wave move and can be faster than the speed of light in vacuum, and thereby give a refractive index below 1. This can occur close to resonance frequencies, for absorbing media, in plasmas, and for X-rays. In the X-ray regime the refractive indices are lower than but very close to 1 (exceptions close to some resonance frequencies). As an example, water has a refractive index of 6999999999740000000\u26600.99999974 = 1 \u2212 6993260000000000000\u26602.6\u00d710 for X-ray radiation at a photon energy of 6985480652946099999\u266030 keV (0.04 nm wavelength)."}

{"question":"is last house on the left true story","answer":false,"passage":"Cunningham served as producer and Craven served as writer and director on the project. Written by Craven in 1971, the original script was intended to be a graphic ``hardcore'' film, with all actors and crew being committed to filming it as such.

The crux of the plot is based on the Swedish ballad ``T\u00f6res d\u00f6ttrar i W\u00e4nge,'' which itself was the basis of Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring (1960), of which Craven was an admirer.

{"question":"are ground squirrels and prairie dogs the same","answer":true,"passage":"The ground squirrels are members of the squirrel family of rodents (Sciuridae) which generally live on or in the ground, rather than trees. The term is most often used for the medium-sized ground squirrels, as the larger ones are more commonly known as marmots (genus Marmota) or prairie dogs, while the smaller and less bushy-tailed ground squirrels tend to be known as chipmunks. Together, they make up the ``marmot tribe'' of squirrels, Marmotini, and the large and mainly ground squirrel subfamily Xerinae, and containing six living genera. Well-known members of this largely Holarctic group are the marmots (Marmota), including the American groundhog, the chipmunks, the susliks (Spermophilus), and the prairie dogs (Cynomys). They are highly variable in size and habitus, but most are remarkably able to rise up on their hind legs and stand fully erect comfortably for prolonged periods. They also tend to be far more gregarious than other squirrels, and many live in colonies with complex social structures.

{"question":"did they use real gorillas in the movie congo","answer":false,"passage":"After the success of The First Great Train Robbery, Crichton decided to write a screenplay specifically for Sean Connery, as the character of Charles Munro, an archetypal ``great white hunter'' akin to H. Rider Haggard's hero, Allan Quatermain. The film was envisioned as an homage to classic pulp adventure tales, and Crichton successfully pitched the movie to 20th Century Fox in 1979 without a fleshed out story. The film ran into problems however when Crichton learned that he could not use a real gorilla to portray the character of Amy, which was a breaking point for him and he left the project. From there, it was offered to several directors including Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter who both passed. A brief attempt was made to revive the project in the late 1980s but to no avail.

{"question":"are mile markers the same as exit numbers","answer":false,"passage":"Nine states as of June 2008, mostly in the Northeast, and the District of Columbia use sequential numbering schemes on at least one highway, although the 2009 edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) requires these jurisdictions to transition to distance-based numbering. Although a ten-year compliance period was proposed for the new edition of the MUTCD, a compliance date for this change was ultimately not adopted with the 2009 edition, meaning that the transition is accomplished through a systematic upgrading of existing signing and there is no specific date by which the change must be implemented. However, the FHWA has required that all federally funded routes with sequential numbering eventually be converted to mileage-based exit numbers. To that end, the FHWA has required each state that currently uses sequential exit numbering to submit a plan to eventually transition to distance-based exit numbers. Some of the states that currently have sequential numbering either have or intend to request a waiver from the Federal Highway Administration to retain their current numbering systems, while others have planned a gradual transition to mileage-based exit numbering over time as existing signage reaches the end of its serviceable life and is replaced."}

{"question":"does everyone in iceland have a surname ending in son","answer":false,"passage":"Icelandic names differ from most current Western family name systems by being patronymic or occasionally matronymic: they indicate the father (or mother) of the child and not the historic family lineage. Iceland shares a common cultural heritage with the Scandinavian countries of Norway, Sweden and Denmark with the Faroe Islands. Icelanders, however, unlike other Nordics, have continued to use their traditional name system, which was formerly used by all Nordic countries except partly Finland. The Icelandic system is thus not based on family names (although some people do have family names and might use both systems). Generally, a person's second name indicates the first name of their father (patronymic) or in some cases mother (matronymic). According to Icelandic naming tradition, second names end in -son or -d\u00f3ttir with few exceptions."}

{"question":"can you get out on a no ball in cricket","answer":true,"passage":"The delivery of a no-ball results in one run -- two under some regulations -- to be added to the batting team's score, and an additional ball must be bowled. In addition, the number of ways in which the batsman can be given out is reduced to three.

{"question":"do goals in third place playoff count for golden boot","answer":true,"passage":"The third place match is generally a high-scoring affair, as no men's match has seen fewer than two goals scored since Poland's 1-0 win over Brazil in 1974, while all bronze-medal games since 1994 (except for 1998 and 2018) have seen four goals or more. For tournament top scorers, the third place match's tendency of attacking football is a great opportunity to win the Golden Shoe, with players such as Salvatore Schillaci (1990), Davor \u0160uker (1998), and Thomas M\u00fcller (2010) getting the goal they needed to take sole possession of the lead. The FIFA Women's World Cup has had only seven editions to date, therefore creating less opportunity for a pattern to form. However, two of the third-place games in that competition have seen fewer than three goals. In 1995, the USA defeated China 2--0.

When the United Kingdom ended its protectorate over Egypt on 28 February 1922, Egypt's Sultan Fouad I issued a decree on 15 March 1922 whereby he adopted the title of King of Egypt. It has been reported that the title change was due not only to Egypt's newly independent status, but also to Fouad I's desire to be accorded the same title as the newly installed rulers of the newly created kingdoms of Hejaz, Syria and Iraq. The only other monarch to be styled King of Egypt was Fouad I's son Farouk I, whose title was changed to King of Egypt and the Sudan in October 1951 following the Wafdist government's unilateral abrogation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936.

{"question":"does a sac fly count as an at bat","answer":false,"passage":"The purpose of not counting a sacrifice fly as an at-bat is to avoid penalizing hitters for a successful action. The sacrifice fly is one of two instances in baseball where a batter is not charged with a time at bat after putting a ball in play; the other is the sacrifice hit (also known as a sacrifice bunt). But, while a sacrifice fly doesn't affect a player's batting average, it counts as a plate appearance and lowers his on-base percentage. A player on a hitting streak will have the hit streak end if he has no official at-bats but has a sacrifice fly."}
{"question":"do all odd numbered highways go north and south","answer":false,"passage":"The route numbers and locations are coordinated by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the United States Department of Transportation. Generally, north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with lowest numbers in the east, the area of the founding thirteen states of the United States, and highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, where roads were first improved most intensively, and highest in the south. Major north--south routes have numbers ending in ``1'' while major east--west routes have numbers ending in ``0''. Three-digit numbered highways are spur routes of parent highways but are not necessarily connected to their parents. Some divided routes exist to provide two alignments for one route, even though many splits have been eliminated.

{"question":"can you put a regular bulb in a 3 way lamp","answer":false,"passage":"A 3-way lamp, also known as a tri-light, is a lamp that uses a 3-way light bulb to produce three levels of light in a low-medium-high configuration. A 3-way lamp requires a 3-way bulb and socket, and a 3-way switch. Unlike an incandescent lamp controlled by a dimmer, each of the filaments operates at full voltage, so the color of the light does not change between the three steps of light available. Certain compact fluorescent lamp bulbs are designed to replace 3-way incandescent bulbs, and have an extra contact and circuitry to bring about similar light level. In recent years, LED three way bulbs have become available as well."}

{"question":"does the a team ever get a pardon","answer":true,"passage":"As the television ratings of The A-Team fell dramatically during the fourth season, the format was changed for the show's final season in 1986--87 in a bid to win back viewers. After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military. General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn, propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions. In order to do so, the A-Team must first escape from their captivity. With the help of a new character, Frankie ``Dishpan Man'' Santana, Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad. The new status of the A-Team, no longer working for themselves, remained for the duration of the fifth season while Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn received star billing along with the principal cast. The missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of Mission: Impossible, and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs, also usually taking place in foreign countries, including successfully overthrowing an island dictator, the rescue of a scientist from East Germany, and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands. These changes proved unsuccessful with viewers, however, and ratings continued to decline. Only 13 episodes aired in the fifth season. In what was supposed to be the final episode, ``The Grey Team'' (although ``Without Reservations'' was broadcast on NBC as the last first-run episode in March 1987), Hannibal, after being misled by Stockwell one time too many, tells him that the team will no longer work for him. At the end, the team discusses what they were going to do if they get their pardon, and it is implied that they would continue doing what they were doing as the A-Team. The character of Howling Mad Murdock can be seen in the final scene wearing a T-shirt that says, ``Fini''."}

{"question":"is creatinine clearance and gfr the same thing","answer":false,"passage":"Renal function, in nephrology, is an indication of the kidney's condition and its role in renal physiology. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. Creatinine clearance rate (C or CrCl) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine per unit time and is a useful measure for approximating the GFR. Creatinine clearance exceeds GFR due to creatinine secretion, which can be blocked by cimetidine. In alternative fashion, overestimation by older serum creatinine methods resulted in an underestimation of creatinine clearance, which provided a less biased estimate of GFR. Both GFR and C may be accurately calculated by comparative measurements of substances in the blood and urine, or estimated by formulas using just a blood test result (eGFR and eC)."}
{"question":"would an electron be considered a type of atom","answer":false,"passage":"Interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics. The Coulomb force interaction between the positive protons within atomic nuclei and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as atoms. Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the binding energy of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding. In 1838, British natural philosopher Richard Laming first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical properties of atoms. Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and J.J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897. Electrons can also participate in nuclear reactions, such as nucleosynthesis in stars, where they are known as beta particles. Electrons can be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high-energy collisions, for instance when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere. The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other charges of the opposite sign. When an electron collides with a positron, both particles can be totally annihilated, producing gamma ray photons."}
{"question":"can you be given a police caution without being arrested","answer":false,"passage":"In recent years a lower level resolution of offences has often been used by police forces in England and Wales instead of a caution.

{"question":"are bank of scotland and rbs the same","answer":false,"passage":"The late 1990s saw a new wave of consolidation in the financial services sector. In 1997, RBS formed a joint venture to set up Tesco Bank. In 1999, the Bank of Scotland launched a hostile takeover bid for English rival NatWest. The Bank of Scotland intended to fund the deal by selling off many of the NatWest's subsidiary companies, including Ulster Bank and Coutts. However, the Royal Bank subsequently tabled a counter-offer, sparking off the largest hostile takeover battle in UK corporate history. A key differentiation from the Bank of Scotland's bid was the Royal Bank's plan to retain all of NatWest's subsidiaries. Although NatWest, one of the ``Big 4'' English clearing banks, was significantly larger than either Scottish bank, it had a recent history of poor financial performance and plans to merge with insurance company Legal & General were not well received, prompting a 26% fall in share price."}

{"question":"what relationship was there between improvements in agriculture and the industrialisation of britain","answer":true,"passage":"The British Agricultural Revolution, or Second Agricultural Revolution, was the unprecedented increase in agricultural production in Britain due to increases in labour and land productivity between the mid-17th and late 19th centuries. Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the century to 1770, and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world. This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales, from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801, though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as population more than tripled to over 32 million. The rise in productivity accelerated the decline of the agricultural share of the labour force, adding to the urban workforce on which industrialization depended: the Agricultural Revolution has therefore been cited as a cause of the Industrial Revolution."}

The design for the tower was Pugin's last design before his final descent into madness and death, and Pugin himself wrote, at the time of Barry's last visit to him to collect the drawings: ``I never worked so hard in my life for Mr Barry for tomorrow I render all the designs for finishing his bell tower & it is beautiful.''"}

The film's theme song, the Broadway-inspired ballad was first recorded by British-American actress Angela Lansbury in her role as the voice of the character Mrs. Potts, and essentially describes the relationship between its two main characters Belle and the Beast, specifically how the couple has learned to accept their differences and in turn change each other for the better. Additionally, the song's lyrics imply that the feeling of love is as timeless and ageless as a ``tale as old as time''. Lansbury's rendition is heard during the famous ballroom sequence between Belle and the Beast, while a shortened chorale version plays in the closing scenes of the film, and the song's motif features frequently in other pieces of Menken's film score. Lansbury was initially hesitant to record ``Beauty and the Beast'' because she felt that it was not suitable for her aging singing voice, but ultimately completed the song in one take."}

About five million people live in Sicily, making it the fourth most populated region in Italy. In the first century after the Italian unification, Sicily had one of the most negative net migration rates among the regions of Italy because of the emigration of millions of people to other European countries, North America, South America and Australia. Like the South of Italy and Sardinia, immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of Italy because workers tend to head to Northern Italy instead, due to better employment and industrial opportunities. The most recent ISTAT figures show around 175,000 immigrants out of the total of almost 5.1 million population (nearly 3.5% of the population); Romanians with more than 50,000 make up the most immigrants, followed by Tunisians, Moroccans, Sri Lankans, Albanians, and others mostly from Eastern Europe.

{"question":"are protestant and church of england the same","answer":false,"passage":"While embracing some themes of the Protestant Reformation, the Church of England also maintains Catholic traditions of the ancient church and teachings of the Church Fathers, unless these are considered contrary to scripture. It accepts the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils concerning the Trinity and the Incarnation. The Church of England also preserves Catholic Order by adhering to episcopal polity, with ordained orders of bishops, priests and deacons. There are differences of opinion within the Church of England over the necessity of episcopacy. Some consider it essential, while others feel it is needed for the proper ordering of the church. In sum these express the 'Via Media' viewpoint that the first five centuries of doctrinal development and church order as approved as acceptable be a kind of yardstick by which to gauge authentic catholicity, as minimum and sufficient; Anglicanism did not emerge as the result of charismatic leaders with particular doctrines. It is light on details compared to Roman Catholic, Reformed and Lutheran teachings. The Bible, the Creeds, Apostolic Order, and the administration of the Sacraments are sufficient to establish Catholicity. Indeed, not one major doctrinal development emerged from the English reformation, Diarmid MacCulloch, The Later Reformation in England, 1990, p. 55. The Reformation in England was initially much concerned about doctrine but the Elizabethan Settlement tried to put a stop to doctrinal contentions. The proponents of further changes, nonetheless, tried to get their way by making changes in Church Order (abolition of bishops), governance (Canon Law) and liturgy ('too Catholic'). They did not succeed because the Monarchy, the Church and resisted and the majority of the population were indifferent. Moreover, ``despite all the assumptions of the Reformation founders of that Church, it had retained a catholic character.'' The Elizabethan Settlement had created a cuckoo in a nest...'' a Protestant theology and program within a largely pre-Reformation Catholic structure whose continuing life would arouse a theological interest in the Catholicism that had created it; and would result in the rejection of predestinarian theology in favor of sacraments, especially the eucharist, ceremonial, and anti-Calvinist doctrine'' (ibid pp. 78--86). The existence of cathedrals ``without substantial alteration'' and ``where the ``old devotional world cast its longest shadow for the future of the ethos that would become Anglicanism,'' p. 79. This is ``One of the great mysteries of the English Reformation,'' ibid that there was no complete break with the past but a muddle that was per force turned into a virtue. The story of the English Reformation is the tale of retreat from the Protestant advance of 1550 which could not proceed further in the face of the opposition of the institution which was rooted in the medieval past, ibid. p. 142 and the adamant opposition of Queen Elizabeth I."}

{"question":"can a tenant get a restraining order against a landlord","answer":true,"passage":"If a landlord is found to be retaliating, he or she will not be able to evict the tenant, who may also be awarded damages from the landlord of one to three months' rent plus attorney's fees. The landlord also cannot willfully deprive the tenant of heat, hot water, gas, electricity, lights, water, or refrigeration service. Nor can the landlord lock out the tenant or remove him\/her from their apartment without going through the proper court procedure. The tenant can ask the court to issue a restraining order, file a criminal complaint against the landlord, or sue him\/her for money damages and attorney's fees. Because of these options for recourse, it may be to the tenant's advantage to complain about code violations in writing before the landlord issues a notice of an eviction or a rent increase. If a tenant attempts to claim retaliation, but did not complain about violations until after he or she received notice from the landlord, the tenant will be found to have no valid claim. The court will not find that the landlord was retaliating against the tenant for an action he or she had not yet taken."}
