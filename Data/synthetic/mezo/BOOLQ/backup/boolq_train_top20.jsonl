{"question": "do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident", "answer": true, "passage": "Good Samaritan laws provide legal protection to individuals who offer reasonable help to those who are, or appear to be, injured, ill, in danger, or incapacitated.

For instance, in common-law regions of Canada, the Good Samaritan doctrine is a legal concept that shields a rescuer who voluntarily aids someone in distress from being sued for any wrongdoing.
