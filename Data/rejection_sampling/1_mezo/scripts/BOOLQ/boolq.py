            Task Description:

            The BoolQ Dataset structure is as follow:
            - The **BoolQ dataset** consists of yes/no questions and short passages. The task is to determine whether the **passage** supports a **"true"** or **"false"** answer to the **question**.
            - The rephrased **passage** must **not change the answerability or truth value** of the original passage with respect to the question.
            - If the original **answer** is **true**, the rephrased passage must continue to support a "yes" response.
            - If the original **answer** is **false**, the rephrased passage must not provide justification to answer "yes".

            We rephrased the passage section of a BoolQ data. You are tasked with verifying whether the Rephrased **passage** maintains consistency with its associated **question**. Specificqally, \
                determine if the Rephrased **passage** remains logically consistent with the given **question** and its **answer** as the same as the Original \
                    **passage**. Below are correctly rephrased examples to guide you:

            answer: true
            Original passage: "These terms are used with respect to reasoning (epistemology) to distinguish ``necessary conclusions from first premises'' (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from ``conclusions based on sense observation'' (which must follow it). Thus, the two kinds of knowledge, justification, or argument, may be glossed:"
            Rephrased passage: "\"These concepts are applied in epistemology to differentiate 'necessary conclusions arising from initial premises'—which precede sensory observation—from 'conclusions derived from sensory observation,' which come afterwards. In this way, the two forms of knowledge, justification, or reasoning can be outlined:\""

Although Joyce is initially shocked, she soon adapts and becomes a source of stability for Buffy and her friends, known as the Scooby Gang, who help in her mission. Joyce eventually accepts Buffy's demon-fighting role with pride and respect for her abilities. Joyce's death from illness in the fifth season necessitates Buffy to embrace adulthood."

            question: "was the leaning tower of pisa built leaning"
            answer: false
            Original passage: "The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries."
            Rephrased passage: "During its construction in the 12th century, the leaning of the tower began, resulting from a foundation that was insufficient on one side due to the soft soil, unable to bear the building's weight. This tilt progressed over the years before the tower's completion in the 14th century. The leaning continued to worsen until stabilization and partial correction efforts were undertaken in the late 20th and early 21st centuries."

            question: "has any nfl team played the superbowl at home"
            answer: false
            Original passage: "The home field curse affects the host team of the Super Bowl. So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Four teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference's title game. From 1966--2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent. It should be noted, however, that the Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played, without regard to the teams that qualify."
            Rephrased passage: "\"The home field disadvantage impacts Super Bowl host teams, as none have reached the Super Bowl in their own stadium. Four teams hosting have reached the divisional playoffs: the Miami Dolphins in 1994 and 1998, the Houston Texans in 2016, and the Minnesota Vikings in 2017, with the Vikings being the first to make it to their conference championship game. Between 1966 and 2011, omitting six Super Bowls held in non-professional team stadiums, host teams experienced 11 winning seasons, 4 even seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Statistically, the likelihood of having as many or more losing seasons by random chance is 7.69 percent, assuming a 50 percent chance of a losing season (ignoring .500 seasons). It is important to note that the Super Bowl venue is chosen several years in advance, regardless of the teams that qualify.\""

            question: "does each australian state have its own constitution"
            answer: true
            Original passage: "In Australia, each state has its own constitution. Each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies, but all the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation in 1901."
            Rephrased passage: "Every Australian state possesses its own constitution, which initially served as the governing framework for each British colony before the establishment of the Australian Constitution. Upon federation in 1901, these states transferred certain powers to the Australian Parliament."

            question: "can you have a right and left bundle branch block"
            answer: true
            Original passage: "A bundle branch block can be diagnosed when the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG exceeds 120 ms. A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex, and may shift the heart's electrical axis slightly to the right. The ECG will show a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. The ECG will show a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Another normal finding with bundle branch block is appropriate T wave discordance. In other words, the T wave will be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony. The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block."
            Rephrased passage: "A bundle branch block diagnosis is confirmed when the QRS complex duration on an ECG surpasses 120 ms. A right bundle branch block generally extends the final part of the QRS complex and may slightly redirect the heart's electrical axis to the right, visible as a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. In contrast, a left bundle branch block causes the entire QRS to widen, often shifting the heart's electrical axis to the left, with an ECG showing a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Typically, bundle branch blocks also involve T wave discordance, meaning the T wave is deflected in the opposite direction of the QRS terminal deflection. Both branch blocks, especially on the left, can result in cardiac dyssynchrony. When both right and left bundle branch blocks are present, they cause a total AV block."

            question: "do you always have to say check in chess"
            answer: false
            Original passage: "In informal games, it is customary to announce ``check'' when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced."
            Rephrased passage: "In casual chess games, players often declare \"check\" when their move threatens the opponent's king. However, in official tournaments, announcing check is uncommon."

            question: "is an australian shepherd the same as an australian cattle dog"
            answer: false
            Original passage: "The Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as ``Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers'' since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds."
            Rephrased passage: "The Texas Heeler, a hybrid between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd, was first listed by the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. Since 1965, the ARF has acknowledged Australian Cattle Dogs without documentation as \"Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers\" and was the pioneer in recognizing the Australian Shepherd. Originally developed for cattle herding, the Texas Heeler has become increasingly popular as a pet and for dog sports. As is typical with mixed breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance can vary based on its parent breeds."

            question: "is tomato puree and tomato sauce the same thing"
            answer: false
            Original passage: "Tomato pur\u00e9e is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. The difference between tomato paste, tomato pur\u00e9e, and tomato sauce is consistency; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce."
            Rephrased passage: "\"Tomato pur\u00e9e is created by cooking and straining tomatoes into a dense liquid form. It differs from tomato paste and tomato sauce mainly in consistency; pur\u00e9e is thicker and more flavorful compared to sauce.\""
