Accepting her imminent death, she ceased resistance.", "hypothesis": "the great muscles of the dragon's wings sent ripplings down the stomach walls", "idx": 88, "label": 0}
{"premise": "Molly enjoyed entertaining the elderly ladies with her stories, which helped them pass their time. Following Miss Louisa's second, more severe stroke in late August and Miss Ellen's additional heart attack, both elderly women passed away within days of each other.

{"premise": "That night, Shannon deliberately avoided Dane, moving cautiously around the house to prevent any further conflicts.

{"premise": "During my meeting with Patterson, which lasted slightly more than 60 minutes, I later discovered this was unprecedented in several ways.

{"premise": "A: When politicians get into office, they often can't fulfill their campaign promises due to lack of power, authority, or willingness. B: I agree.

{"premise": "A: Indeed, they applied significant pressure on him both externally and internally. It's interesting to observe their gameplay - he resembles many quarterbacks who seem to perform at their peak when under intense pressure, particularly in those crucial final minutes of a game or when the season is on the line. B: I see. A: I still haven't completely understood this phenomenon - whether it's because they're in a certain mindset during the first three quarters, or if there's no sense of urgency until later, or perhaps if something triggers that adrenaline rush at critical moments.", "hypothesis": "they have got it won", "idx": 126, "label": 2}
{"premise": "A: You seem to have more knowledge about this topic than I do. B: Well, I believe the current system is adequate as it is.

{"premise": "A: If they weren't allocating so much budget to drug testing, employees might have received salary increases.

{"premise": "B: I agree with that point. A: So. B: Another argument people make is that the death penalty deters crime, but I strongly disagree with that notion. I don't believe someone about to commit a capital offense would pause and think, \"I was planning to murder and dismember this individual, but since I might face execution if caught, I'll reconsider.\" That's just not how criminal psychology operates in these situations.

{"premise": "A: I'm puzzled about why urban schools have such high dropout rates. B: I'm equally uncertain about that. I don't think it's fair to place the responsibility solely on educational institutions, though I'm not entirely sure where accountability should lie. These high dropout rates typically coincide with areas experiencing poverty and criminal activity - they seem interconnected. Breaking any part of this cycle - whether addressing dropout rates, crime, or poverty conditions - could potentially improve the overall situation. All three are social challenges that government intervention could potentially address in various ways.

So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia.

{"premise":"Robert Erwin, president of Biosource, called Plant Genetic's approach ``interesting'' and ``novel,'' and ``complementary rather than competitive.'' ``There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds,'' he said.

{"premise":"So who knows? In a generation or two some of the New Crowd may attain true respectability, perhaps to be displaced in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous raptors.
