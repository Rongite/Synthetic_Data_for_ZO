{"question": "do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident", "answer": true, "passage": "Good Samaritan laws provide legal protection to individuals who render aid to someone who is, or whom they assume to be, injured, sick, endangered, or otherwise incapacitated.

In some common-law regions of Canada, the good Samaritan doctrine ensures that a person who voluntarily assists a victim in distress cannot be successfully sued for any missteps. This principle serves to lessen the apprehension of aiding individuals due to possible legal consequences from errors in help provided. Conversely, a duty to rescue law demands that people provide assistance, holding those who neglect to do so accountable."}

Participants were instructed to count the crossings of several white moving objects over the vertical midpoint of a display, while disregarding multiple black moving objects. The unexpected stimulus was a gray cross moving horizontally across the display at varying distances from the vertical midpoint, differing between participants. The researchers found that susceptibility to inattentional blindness rises with age, supporting Graham and Burke's findings, with an increase in age of ten years leading to a 1.3 times higher likelihood of experiencing inattentional blindness. Additionally, they confirmed Most and colleagues' observation that the probability of such blindness intensifies as the distance grows between the observer's attention focus and the unexpected object. However, they noted that age's relationship with inattentional blindness remains unchanged by the unexpected object's distance from the attention focus, indicating that the useful field of view doesn't mediate age-related inattentional blindness."}

{"question": "is the graviton part of the standard model", "answer": false, "passage": "The inclusion of gravitons in theoretical models often encounters significant issues. Incorporating gravitons into the Standard Model or similar quantum field theories leads to considerable challenges at energy levels near or exceeding the Planck scale. This stems from infinite quantities emerging due to quantum effects; specifically, gravity cannot be renormalized. Since classical general relativity and quantum mechanics appear fundamentally incompatible at these energy scales, the situation is problematic from a theoretical standpoint. An alternative is to use string theories, which are quantum gravity theories that align with classical general relativity and field theory at low energies, but are fully quantum mechanical, include a graviton, and are considered potentially mathematically consistent."}

However, a petition in 2007 advocating for Saint David's Day to be a bank holiday was denied by the office of then British Prime Minister Tony Blair."}
{"question": "are the normal force and force of gravity always equal", "answer": false, "passage": "In mechanics, the normal force \\( F_n \\) is a component of the contact force acting perpendicular to the surface an object contacts, like a floor or table keeping an object from falling. Here, \"normal\" refers to perpendicularity rather than the everyday meaning of common or usual. For instance, if a person stands still on level ground, the ground reaction force acting on them is purely normal. On a slope, if they remain stationary, the ground reaction force divides into two parts: a normal force perpendicular to the slope and a frictional force parallel to it. Another scenario occurs when an object strikes a surface at speed, where the normal force causes rapid deceleration depending on the flexibility of both the surface and the object."}

The objective is to enhance their driving abilities and avoid being titled Canada\u2019s Worst Driver\u2014short seasons may feature nine drivers. The journey begins with contestants driving from a location about an hour away to the Centre, following provided directions. Upon their arrival, their driving license is taken (in the first two seasons, it was their car keys). The initial episode culminates with an assessment challenge or obstacle course to test their driving skills. The series is famed for its tough obstacle courses, where contestants must navigate tight spaces. To demonstrate that these challenges can be achieved, host Andrew Younghusband, an average driver himself, attempts each one before the contestants. From the second episode onwards, each participant undergoes a performance evaluation with Andrew and four experts. They decide which contestants progress enough to graduate and receive their licenses back. Those who graduate leave with their nominators in the car they arrived in. However, experts may decide not to graduate anyone, graduate multiple contestants, or expel individuals who are unmotivated to improve, should not be driving, or cannot continue for medical or legal reasons. In such cases, expelled contestants also have their licenses returned and go home with their nominators. Even expelled contestants may still be eligible for the title, as was evident in Canada's Worst Driver Ever when Dale Pitton was expelled but returned for the trophy ceremony. In rare, severe cases, the experts might request the Ministry of Transport to review a contestant\u2019s license if deemed medically unfit. This occurred twice; once in Canada's Worst Driver 4 with Donna Hicks, and again in Canada's Worst Driver Ever with Dale. The competition narrows until three contestants remain. They face a final set of challenges including a slalom and the Mega Challenge\u2014an extensive obstacle course incorporating elements of previous tests, followed by a city driving exam, which has been held in Hamilton, Ontario since season seven.

One of the early proponents of using mercury was Paracelsus, who endorsed its application due to its beneficial effects on the Arabic approach to treating leprosy, a condition believed to be akin to syphilis. In 1496, Giorgio Sommariva of Verona reportedly used mercury to treat syphilis and is often credited as the first to do so, despite uncertainties about his medical credentials. Throughout the sixteenth century, mercury was given to syphilitic patients through various methods, such as topical application, plaster, and oral intake. Another technique involved \"fumigation,\" where mercury vapors were generated over a fire, and patients either sat on an open-bottomed seat above the coals or were placed in a steam-filled box (dubbed a \u201ctabernacle\u201d) exposing their bodies, excluding the head.

A low concentration is categorized as oligozoospermia. After a vasectomy, success is indicated by an azoospermic result, meaning no sperm are detected. Some definitions of success include finding rare/non-motile sperm under 100,000 per milliliter. It is often recommended to perform a follow-up semen analysis to confirm counts remain low, ensuring no recanalization, and in some cases, a repeat vasectomy may be necessary."}

{"question": "is the movie the mission based on a true story", "answer": true, "passage": "\"The Mission draws from real events related to the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, when Spain handed over parts of Jesuit-controlled Paraguay to Portugal. A notable theme in the film is the looming suppression of the Jesuits, highlighted when Father Gabriel is cautioned by the narrator, Cardinal Altamirano, a former Jesuit himself. Altamirano, reflecting in 1758, parallels the historical Jesuit from Andalusia, Father Luis Altamirano, dispatched by Jesuit Superior General Ignacio Visconti to Paraguay in 1752 to facilitate the territorial handover from Spain to Portugal. He managed the relocation of seven missions located south and east of the R\u00edo Uruguay, inhabited by the Guaran\u00ed and Jesuits since the 1600s. Spain offered compensation of 4,000 pesos per mission, translating to less than 1 peso per person for the approximately 30,000 Guaran\u00ed residents, despite the lands, livestock, and infrastructure being valued between 7 and 16 million pesos. The film culminates in the historical Guaran\u00ed War of 1754\u20131756, where the Guaran\u00ed valiantly defended against the Spanish-Portuguese enforcement of the Treaty of Madrid. A historically accurate replica of one of the missions, S\u00e3o Miguel das Miss\u00f5es, was recreated for the film.\""}

{"question": "does puerto rico have to follow us laws", "answer": true, "passage": "Puerto Rico is constitutionally under the plenary powers of Congress as per the territorial clause in Article IV, Section 3, of the U.S. Constitution. This means U.S. federal laws are applicable in Puerto Rico, despite it not being a state and its residents lacking voting representation in Congress. The Federal Relations Act of 1950 ensures that all federal laws, unless deemed \"locally inapplicable,\" automatically apply in Puerto Rico. Since the legislation in 1950 and 1952, only two district court rulings have found a federal law inapplicable to Puerto Rico, with the most recent being overturned on appeal. Efr\u00e9n Rivera Ramos, a law professor at the University of Puerto Rico, explains that while a state's government derives its authority from its people, a territory's government exists solely due to the U.S. Thus, plenary power is akin to exclusive power, allowing the U.S. government to exert authority over territories in ways it cannot over states. Ramos cites Justice Harlan in Grafton v. United States, 206 U.S. 333 (1907), stating that U.S. jurisdiction over territories and their inhabitants is supreme for legitimate governance purposes. However, Ramos notes that this power is not absolute, as it is limited by certain fundamental rights inherent to anyone under U.S. authority."}
{"question": "does every us citizen have a social security number", "answer": false, "passage": "Social Security initially functioned as a universal tax, but with the introduction of Medicare in 1965, religious groups established before 1951 were permitted to opt out.

The Old Order Amish have actively opposed universal Social Security, challenging requirements such as providing a Social Security number for obtaining a hunting license."}

A less common proposal is that the stutter was added to help the band imply an expletive in the lyrics: \"Why don't you all fff... fade away!\" Nonetheless, producer Shel Talmy claimed it was merely \"one of those happy accidents\" they decided to retain. Roger Daltrey has remarked that he hadn\u2019t practiced the song beforehand, felt nervous, and couldn\u2019t hear his voice through the monitors. The stutter emerged as he adjusted the lyrics to fit the music, and the band chose to keep it.

{"question": "is it possible to heat water above its boiling point", "answer": true, "passage": "\"Superheated water refers to liquid water held under pressure at temperatures from the standard boiling point, 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F), up to the critical point of 374 \u00b0C (705 \u00b0F).

{"question": "do universal life policies have a cash value", "answer": true, "passage": "\"Universal life insurance, commonly abbreviated as UL, is a cash value life insurance product primarily available in the United States. The policy credits any premiums paid over the insurance cost to the cash value.

Interest rates are set by the insurer but come with a contractual minimum, often 2%. If tied to a financial index like stocks or bonds, the policy is known as an 'Indexed Universal Life' contract. These policies are beneficial in offering guaranteed level premiums throughout the insured's lifetime at lower initial costs compared to similar whole life policies, although the insurance cost rises over time based on a cost index table, typically found within the contract. This allows for straightforward cost comparisons across insurers and is advantageous in irrevocable life insurance trusts since cash considerations are negligible.\""}
{"question": "can someone born on a military base be president", "answer": true, "passage": "The former Panama Canal Zone and its associated military installations were not considered U.S. territory at their time.

{"question": "does canada's prime minister hold a seat in the house of commons", "answer": false, "passage": "The House of Commons does not directly elect the prime minister, but it influences the position indirectly.

This has not occurred at the federal level in Canada, but has happened in provincial governments. The leader of the second-largest party, or the largest party not in government in a coalition, usually becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition. Additionally, by unwritten tradition, the prime minister is a member of the House of Commons rather than the Senate. Only two prime ministers, Sir John Abbott (1891\u20131892) and Sir Mackenzie Bowell (1894\u20131896), governed from the Senate, both assuming office after a prime minister's death and without contesting elections."}

{"question": "can you remove venom glands from a snake", "answer": true, "passage": "A venomoid is a type of venomous snake that has been surgically altered to either eliminate or hinder the production of snake venom. This surgery is often performed on venomous snakes kept as pets or employed in public displays to mitigate the danger of potential bites. Venom glands or teeth of showcased snakes can be removed through surgery or crude mutilation; however, some or all such methods are deemed illegal and unethical. Fang removal is rare because snakes often grow new teeth, and the more severe option of excising the underlying maxillary bone could be lethal. Typically, venomoid procedures involve either the extraction of the venom gland or the cutting of the duct between the gland and the fang. Nonetheless, there have been instances where the duct and gland regenerate, leading to instances where supposedly \"safe\" snakes have fatally bitten mice or envenomated humans."}

{"question":"can you phone 999 without a sim card","answer":false,"passage":"The pan-European 112 code was introduced in the UK in April 1995 with little publicity. It connects to existing 999 circuits.

All mobile telephones will make emergency calls with the keypad locked. Originally a valid SIM card was not required to make a 999\/112 emergency call in the UK. However, as a result of high numbers of untraceable hoax calls being made, this feature is now blocked by all UK networks. Most UK mobile telephone handsets will dial 999\/112 without a SIM inserted (or with a locked\/invalid SIM), but the call will not be connected. Following the blocking of SIM-less calls, in 2009 the UK networks introduced emergency call roaming.

A rotation is different from other types of motions: translations, which have no fixed points, and (hyperplane) reflections, each of them having an entire (n \u2212 1)-dimensional flat of fixed points in a n-dimensional space. A clockwise rotation is a negative magnitude so a counterclockwise turn has a positive magnitude."}

{"question":"are great horned owls active during the day","answer":false,"passage":"Like most owls, the great horned owl makes great use of secrecy and stealth. Due to its natural-colored plumage, it is well camouflaged both while active at night and while roosting during the day. During the daytime it roosts usually in large trees (including snags & large hollows but usually thick branches) but may occasionally be in crevices or small caves in rocks or in dense shrubbery. Pine and other coniferous trees may be preferred where available since they are particularly dense and provide cover throughout the year. Typically, males have a favorite roosting site not far from the nest, sometimes used over successive years. While roosting, great horned owls may rest in the ``tall-thin'' position, where they sit as erect and hold themselves as slim as is possible. The kind of posture is well known as a further method of camouflage for other owls, like long-eared owls or great grey owls, especially if humans or other potential mammalian carnivores approach them. The Eurasian eagle owl rarely, if ever, assumes the tall-thin position. Outside of the nesting season, great horned owls may roost wherever their foraging path ends at dawn. Generally great horned owls are active at night, although in some areas may be active in the late afternoon or early morning. At dusk, the owl utters a few calls before flying to a more open sing-post, i.e. large bare branch or large rocks to deliver song. Normally several perches are used to mark occupied territory or to attract a female. Despite its camouflage and cryptic locations, this species can still sometimes be spotted on its daytime roosts, especially by American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Since owls are, next to red-tailed hawks, perhaps the main predator of crows and their young, crows sometimes congregate from considerable distances to mob owls and caw angrily at them for hours on end. When the owls try to fly off to avoid this harassment, they are often followed by the corvids."}

{"question":"is it dangerous to eat a bay leaf","answer":true,"passage":"Some members of the laurel family, as well as the unrelated but visually similar mountain laurel and cherry laurel, have leaves that are poisonous to humans and livestock. While these plants are not sold anywhere for culinary use, their visual similarity to bay leaves has led to the oft-repeated belief that bay leaves should be removed from food after cooking because they are poisonous. This is not true; bay leaves may be eaten without toxic effect. However, they remain unpleasantly stiff even after thorough cooking, and if swallowed whole or in large pieces, they may pose a risk of harming the digestive tract or causing choking. There have been cases of intestinal perforations caused by swallowing bay leaves, so unless the leaves in the recipe have been ground they should be removed from the food before serving; otherwise, the risk of a surgical emergency remains. Thus, most recipes that use bay leaves will recommend their removal after the cooking process has finished."}

After four years on the ballot, Palmeiro failed to be named on 5% of ballots in 2014, and accordingly his name was removed from the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot for future elections, although it is possible that the Veterans Committee could in the future enshrine him.

{"question":"was tom from tom and jerry called jasper","answer":true,"passage":"Tom (named ``Jasper'' in his debut appearance) is a grey and white domestic shorthair cat. (``Tom'' is a generic name for a male cat.) He is usually but not always, portrayed as living a comfortable, or even pampered life, while Jerry (named ``Jinx'' in his debut appearance) is a small, brown, house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom. Despite being very energetic, determined and much larger, Tom is no match for Jerry's wits. Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size, approximately the equivalent of Tom's, lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts. Although cats typically chase mice to eat them, it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to eat Jerry. Most of his attempts are just to torment or humiliate Jerry, sometimes in revenge, and sometimes to obtain a reward from a human for catching Jerry.

{"question":"has ireland ever been part of the uk","answer":true,"passage":"The 1614 overthrow of the Catholic majority in the Irish Parliament was realised principally through the creation of numerous new boroughs which were dominated by the new settlers. By the end of the seventeenth century, recusants (adherents to the older religion were now termed), representing some 85% of Ireland's population, were then banned from the Irish Parliament. Protestant domination of Ireland was confirmed after two periods of war between Catholics and Protestants in 1641-52 and 1689-91. Political power thereafter rested entirely in the hands of a Protestant Ascendancy minority, while Catholics and members of dissenting Protestant denominations suffered severe political and economic privations under the Penal Laws. The Irish Parliament was abolished from 1 January 1801 in the wake of the republican United Irishmen Rebellion and Ireland became an integral part of a new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the provisions of the Acts of Union 1800. Although promised a repeal of the Test Act, Catholics were not granted full rights until Catholic Emancipation was attained throughout the new UK in 1829.

{"question":"is the sweat gland part of the endocrine system","answer":false,"passage":"The endocrine system is the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs. The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen."}

{"question":"do fatty acid synthesis and degradation occur in the same location of the cell","answer":false,"passage":"Fatty acids are broken down to acetyl-CoA by means of beta oxidation inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose."}

The drop kick was supplanted by the place kick, which cannot be attempted out of a formation generally used as a running or passing set.

{"question":"is it possible to have a refractive index less than 1","answer":true,"passage":"According to the theory of relativity, no information can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum, but this does not mean that the refractive index cannot be lower than 1. The refractive index measures the phase velocity of light, which does not carry information. The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests of the wave move and can be faster than the speed of light in vacuum, and thereby give a refractive index below 1. This can occur close to resonance frequencies, for absorbing media, in plasmas, and for X-rays. In the X-ray regime the refractive indices are lower than but very close to 1 (exceptions close to some resonance frequencies). As an example, water has a refractive index of 6999999999740000000\u26600.99999974 = 1 \u2212 6993260000000000000\u26602.6\u00d710 for X-ray radiation at a photon energy of 6985480652946099999\u266030 keV (0.04 nm wavelength)."}

It has medical uses, such as to supply glucose for people with glycogen storage disease. Like many products in dust form, it can be hazardous in large quantities due to its flammability."}
{"question":"is a cpu a input or output device","answer":true,"passage":"In computer architecture, the combination of the CPU and main memory, to which the CPU can read or write directly using individual instructions, is considered the brain of a computer. Any transfer of information to or from the CPU\/memory combo, for example by reading data from a disk drive, is considered I\/O. The CPU and its supporting circuitry may provide memory-mapped I\/O that is used in low-level computer programming, such as in the implementation of device drivers, or may provide access to I\/O channels. An I\/O algorithm is one designed to exploit locality and perform efficiently when exchanging data with a secondary storage device, such as a disk drive."}

{"question":"are mile markers the same as exit numbers","answer":false,"passage":"Nine states as of June 2008, mostly in the Northeast, and the District of Columbia use sequential numbering schemes on at least one highway, although the 2009 edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) requires these jurisdictions to transition to distance-based numbering. Although a ten-year compliance period was proposed for the new edition of the MUTCD, a compliance date for this change was ultimately not adopted with the 2009 edition, meaning that the transition is accomplished through a systematic upgrading of existing signing and there is no specific date by which the change must be implemented. However, the FHWA has required that all federally funded routes with sequential numbering eventually be converted to mileage-based exit numbers. To that end, the FHWA has required each state that currently uses sequential exit numbering to submit a plan to eventually transition to distance-based exit numbers. Some of the states that currently have sequential numbering either have or intend to request a waiver from the Federal Highway Administration to retain their current numbering systems, while others have planned a gradual transition to mileage-based exit numbering over time as existing signage reaches the end of its serviceable life and is replaced."}
{"question":"can you be allergic to your own perspiration","answer":true,"passage":"A sweat allergy is the exacerbation of atopic dermatitis associated with an elevated body temperature and resulting increases in the production of sweat. It appears as small reddish wheals that become visible in response to increased temperature and resulting production of sweat. It can affect all ages. Sweating can trigger intense itching or cholinergic urticaria. The protein MGL_1304 secreted by mycobiota present on the skin such as Malassezia globosa acts as a histamine or antigen. People can be desensitized using their own samples of sweat that have been purified that contains small amounts of the allergen. The allergy is not due to the sweat itself but instead to an allergy-producing protein secreted by bacteria found on the skin."}

On a mission in space, the Watcher told Black Panther and Storm that their children would have a special destiny. Upon Reed and Sue's return to the Fantastic Four, Storm and the Black Panther leave, with Storm returning to the Uncanny X-Men to help out with events in Messiah Complex. After joining with the X-Men again, Storm is confronted by Cyclops over her position as an X-Man and a Queen.

Storm reacts by returning to Wakanda to face a despondent Black Panther, with the two seemingly falling out with each other, although it is later revealed that the Black Panther has been possessed by the Shadow King. After incapacitating the possessed T'Challa, Storm battled Cyclops, who had been mentally enthralled by the Shadow King to kill the other X-Men.

{"question":"does everyone in iceland have a surname ending in son","answer":false,"passage":"Icelandic names differ from most current Western family name systems by being patronymic or occasionally matronymic: they indicate the father (or mother) of the child and not the historic family lineage. Iceland shares a common cultural heritage with the Scandinavian countries of Norway, Sweden and Denmark with the Faroe Islands. Icelanders, however, unlike other Nordics, have continued to use their traditional name system, which was formerly used by all Nordic countries except partly Finland. The Icelandic system is thus not based on family names (although some people do have family names and might use both systems). Generally, a person's second name indicates the first name of their father (patronymic) or in some cases mother (matronymic). According to Icelandic naming tradition, second names end in -son or -d\u00f3ttir with few exceptions."}

{"question":"can you get out on a no ball in cricket","answer":true,"passage":"The delivery of a no-ball results in one run -- two under some regulations -- to be added to the batting team's score, and an additional ball must be bowled. In addition, the number of ways in which the batsman can be given out is reduced to three.

{"question":"do goals in third place playoff count for golden boot","answer":true,"passage":"The third place match is generally a high-scoring affair, as no men's match has seen fewer than two goals scored since Poland's 1-0 win over Brazil in 1974, while all bronze-medal games since 1994 (except for 1998 and 2018) have seen four goals or more. For tournament top scorers, the third place match's tendency of attacking football is a great opportunity to win the Golden Shoe, with players such as Salvatore Schillaci (1990), Davor \u0160uker (1998), and Thomas M\u00fcller (2010) getting the goal they needed to take sole possession of the lead. The FIFA Women's World Cup has had only seven editions to date, therefore creating less opportunity for a pattern to form. However, two of the third-place games in that competition have seen fewer than three goals. In 1995, the USA defeated China 2--0. In 1999, the third-place match between Brazil and Norway ended in a scoreless draw and penalty shootout (won by Brazil), as did the final between the USA and China (won by the USA). In 2015, the third place match between Germany and England was the first to go to extra time, and in the second period of extra time, England scored a single penalty kick goal and held on to the lead to upset Germany."}

When the United Kingdom ended its protectorate over Egypt on 28 February 1922, Egypt's Sultan Fouad I issued a decree on 15 March 1922 whereby he adopted the title of King of Egypt. It has been reported that the title change was due not only to Egypt's newly independent status, but also to Fouad I's desire to be accorded the same title as the newly installed rulers of the newly created kingdoms of Hejaz, Syria and Iraq. The only other monarch to be styled King of Egypt was Fouad I's son Farouk I, whose title was changed to King of Egypt and the Sudan in October 1951 following the Wafdist government's unilateral abrogation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936.

The sacrifice fly is one of two instances in baseball where a batter is not charged with a time at bat after putting a ball in play; the other is the sacrifice hit (also known as a sacrifice bunt).

A player on a hitting streak will have the hit streak end if he has no official at-bats but has a sacrifice fly."}
{"question":"do all odd numbered highways go north and south","answer":false,"passage":"The route numbers and locations are coordinated by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).

Major north--south routes have numbers ending in ``1'' while major east--west routes have numbers ending in ``0''. Three-digit numbered highways are spur routes of parent highways but are not necessarily connected to their parents.

A 3-way lamp requires a 3-way bulb and socket, and a 3-way switch. Unlike an incandescent lamp controlled by a dimmer, each of the filaments operates at full voltage, so the color of the light does not change between the three steps of light available. Certain compact fluorescent lamp bulbs are designed to replace 3-way incandescent bulbs, and have an extra contact and circuitry to bring about similar light level. In recent years, LED three way bulbs have become available as well."}

{"question":"does the a team ever get a pardon","answer":true,"passage":"As the television ratings of The A-Team fell dramatically during the fourth season, the format was changed for the show's final season in 1986--87 in a bid to win back viewers. After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military. General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn, propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions. In order to do so, the A-Team must first escape from their captivity. With the help of a new character, Frankie ``Dishpan Man'' Santana, Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad. The new status of the A-Team, no longer working for themselves, remained for the duration of the fifth season while Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn received star billing along with the principal cast. The missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of Mission: Impossible, and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs, also usually taking place in foreign countries, including successfully overthrowing an island dictator, the rescue of a scientist from East Germany, and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands. These changes proved unsuccessful with viewers, however, and ratings continued to decline. Only 13 episodes aired in the fifth season. In what was supposed to be the final episode, ``The Grey Team'' (although ``Without Reservations'' was broadcast on NBC as the last first-run episode in March 1987), Hannibal, after being misled by Stockwell one time too many, tells him that the team will no longer work for him. At the end, the team discusses what they were going to do if they get their pardon, and it is implied that they would continue doing what they were doing as the A-Team. The character of Howling Mad Murdock can be seen in the final scene wearing a T-shirt that says, ``Fini''."}

{"question":"is creatinine clearance and gfr the same thing","answer":false,"passage":"Renal function, in nephrology, is an indication of the kidney's condition and its role in renal physiology. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. Creatinine clearance rate (C or CrCl) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine per unit time and is a useful measure for approximating the GFR. Creatinine clearance exceeds GFR due to creatinine secretion, which can be blocked by cimetidine. In alternative fashion, overestimation by older serum creatinine methods resulted in an underestimation of creatinine clearance, which provided a less biased estimate of GFR. Both GFR and C may be accurately calculated by comparative measurements of substances in the blood and urine, or estimated by formulas using just a blood test result (eGFR and eC)."}
{"question":"would an electron be considered a type of atom","answer":false,"passage":"Interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics. The Coulomb force interaction between the positive protons within atomic nuclei and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as atoms. Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the binding energy of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding. In 1838, British natural philosopher Richard Laming first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical properties of atoms. Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and J.J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897. Electrons can also participate in nuclear reactions, such as nucleosynthesis in stars, where they are known as beta particles. Electrons can be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high-energy collisions, for instance when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere. The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other charges of the opposite sign. When an electron collides with a positron, both particles can be totally annihilated, producing gamma ray photons."}
{"question":"can you be given a police caution without being arrested","answer":false,"passage":"In recent years a lower level resolution of offences has often been used by police forces in England and Wales instead of a caution. This is usually called a 'community resolution' and invariably requires less police time as offenders are not arrested. A community resolution does not require any formal record but the offender should admit the offence and the victim should be happy with this method of informal resolution. Concerns have been expressed over the use of community resolution for violent offences, in particular 'domestic violence'."}

{"question":"what relationship was there between improvements in agriculture and the industrialisation of britain","answer":true,"passage":"The British Agricultural Revolution, or Second Agricultural Revolution, was the unprecedented increase in agricultural production in Britain due to increases in labour and land productivity between the mid-17th and late 19th centuries. Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the century to 1770, and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world. This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales, from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801, though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as population more than tripled to over 32 million. The rise in productivity accelerated the decline of the agricultural share of the labour force, adding to the urban workforce on which industrialization depended: the Agricultural Revolution has therefore been cited as a cause of the Industrial Revolution."}

Additionally, the song's lyrics imply that the feeling of love is as timeless and ageless as a ``tale as old as time''. Lansbury's rendition is heard during the famous ballroom sequence between Belle and the Beast, while a shortened chorale version plays in the closing scenes of the film, and the song's motif features frequently in other pieces of Menken's film score.

{"question":"is sicily the most populated region in italy","answer":false,"passage":"Sicily is a melting pot of a variety of different cultures and ethnicities, including the original Italic people, the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Saracens, Normans, Swabians, Aragonese, Lombards, Spaniards, French, and Albanians, each contributing to the island's culture and genetic makeup. About five million people live in Sicily, making it the fourth most populated region in Italy. In the first century after the Italian unification, Sicily had one of the most negative net migration rates among the regions of Italy because of the emigration of millions of people to other European countries, North America, South America and Australia. Like the South of Italy and Sardinia, immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of Italy because workers tend to head to Northern Italy instead, due to better employment and industrial opportunities. The most recent ISTAT figures show around 175,000 immigrants out of the total of almost 5.1 million population (nearly 3.5% of the population); Romanians with more than 50,000 make up the most immigrants, followed by Tunisians, Moroccans, Sri Lankans, Albanians, and others mostly from Eastern Europe.

{"question":"can there be outliers in a normal distribution","answer":false,"passage":"Deletion of outlier data is a controversial practice frowned upon by many scientists and science instructors; while mathematical criteria provide an objective and quantitative method for data rejection, they do not make the practice more scientifically or methodologically sound, especially in small sets or where a normal distribution cannot be assumed. Rejection of outliers is more acceptable in areas of practice where the underlying model of the process being measured and the usual distribution of measurement error are confidently known. An outlier resulting from an instrument reading error may be excluded but it is desirable that the reading is at least verified."}

{"question":"is the emergency brake and parking brake the same thing","answer":true,"passage":"In road vehicles, the parking brake, also called hand brake, emergency brake, or e-brake, is used to keep the vehicle stationary and in many cases also perform an emergency stop.

In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking.

{"question":"are protestant and church of england the same","answer":false,"passage":"While embracing some themes of the Protestant Reformation, the Church of England also maintains Catholic traditions of the ancient church and teachings of the Church Fathers, unless these are considered contrary to scripture. It accepts the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils concerning the Trinity and the Incarnation. The Church of England also preserves Catholic Order by adhering to episcopal polity, with ordained orders of bishops, priests and deacons. There are differences of opinion within the Church of England over the necessity of episcopacy. Some consider it essential, while others feel it is needed for the proper ordering of the church. In sum these express the 'Via Media' viewpoint that the first five centuries of doctrinal development and church order as approved as acceptable be a kind of yardstick by which to gauge authentic catholicity, as minimum and sufficient; Anglicanism did not emerge as the result of charismatic leaders with particular doctrines. It is light on details compared to Roman Catholic, Reformed and Lutheran teachings. The Bible, the Creeds, Apostolic Order, and the administration of the Sacraments are sufficient to establish Catholicity. Indeed, not one major doctrinal development emerged from the English reformation, Diarmid MacCulloch, The Later Reformation in England, 1990, p. 55. The Reformation in England was initially much concerned about doctrine but the Elizabethan Settlement tried to put a stop to doctrinal contentions. The proponents of further changes, nonetheless, tried to get their way by making changes in Church Order (abolition of bishops), governance (Canon Law) and liturgy ('too Catholic'). They did not succeed because the Monarchy, the Church and resisted and the majority of the population were indifferent. Moreover, ``despite all the assumptions of the Reformation founders of that Church, it had retained a catholic character.'' The Elizabethan Settlement had created a cuckoo in a nest...'' a Protestant theology and program within a largely pre-Reformation Catholic structure whose continuing life would arouse a theological interest in the Catholicism that had created it; and would result in the rejection of predestinarian theology in favor of sacraments, especially the eucharist, ceremonial, and anti-Calvinist doctrine'' (ibid pp. 78--86). The existence of cathedrals ``without substantial alteration'' and ``where the ``old devotional world cast its longest shadow for the future of the ethos that would become Anglicanism,'' p. 79. This is ``One of the great mysteries of the English Reformation,'' ibid that there was no complete break with the past but a muddle that was per force turned into a virtue. The story of the English Reformation is the tale of retreat from the Protestant advance of 1550 which could not proceed further in the face of the opposition of the institution which was rooted in the medieval past, ibid. p. 142 and the adamant opposition of Queen Elizabeth I."}

{"question":"can a tenant get a restraining order against a landlord","answer":true,"passage":"If a landlord is found to be retaliating, he or she will not be able to evict the tenant, who may also be awarded damages from the landlord of one to three months' rent plus attorney's fees. The landlord also cannot willfully deprive the tenant of heat, hot water, gas, electricity, lights, water, or refrigeration service. Nor can the landlord lock out the tenant or remove him\/her from their apartment without going through the proper court procedure. The tenant can ask the court to issue a restraining order, file a criminal complaint against the landlord, or sue him\/her for money damages and attorney's fees. Because of these options for recourse, it may be to the tenant's advantage to complain about code violations in writing before the landlord issues a notice of an eviction or a rent increase. If a tenant attempts to claim retaliation, but did not complain about violations until after he or she received notice from the landlord, the tenant will be found to have no valid claim. The court will not find that the landlord was retaliating against the tenant for an action he or she had not yet taken."}
